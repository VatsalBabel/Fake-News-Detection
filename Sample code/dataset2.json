   "text": "Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.Photos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.In the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.While ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.Abu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR— Islamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.ISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.",

   "text": "(CNN) -- A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported.AP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a \"relatively small\" meteorite that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\"NASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.Local media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event.\"All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,\" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website.But NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical.\"It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,\" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post.\"The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.\"The Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel.NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon.Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people.The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth.NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.CNN's Jeff Greene contributed to this report.",

   "text": "mboxCreate('FoxNews-Politics-Autoplay-Videos-In-Articles');U.S. military officials say they are investigating claims that Islamic State fighters seized a cache of weapons that were airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces and meant for Kurdish militiamen.A video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State showed a cache of weapons including hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Their claims would appear to correspond with those of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the militants had seized at least one cache.U.S. officials said Tuesday they could not confirm the video's authenticity but are looking into the claims.\"We just don't know. We're still looking at it,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said when asked about the video, while stressing that the \"vast majority\" of supplies ended up in the right hands.The supplies were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant Islamic State has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.In all, 28 bundles of equipment -- including medical supplies, weapons and ammunition -- were dropped. The Pentagon says 27 bundles were received.According to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren, \"one of those bundles drifted off course.\" But he said \"we subsequently destroyed it with an airstrike.\"On Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said \"Team USA.\"Kirby acknowledged the conflicting accounts. \"We're aware that one bundle did not make it into the right hands and you saw the CENTCOM release indicating that they destroyed it from the air,\" he said. \"All of that doesn't take away from the notion that this video is out there and that it could in fact be that bundle. We just don't know.\"The lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a large Islamic State unit.Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.Fox News' Justin Fishel and Greg Palkot and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

   "text": "DUBAI - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: \"It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.\"Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.\"God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,\" he wrote in his ruling.That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.\"They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,\" one Twitter user wrote.Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a \"snow bride\" wearing a bra and lipstick. \"The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,\" he wrote.A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:\"A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,\" the user wrote.Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. \"It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,\" one wrote.\"May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.\"Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.",

   "text": "Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:“911, what’s your emergency?”“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”Winters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”Tom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There’s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”Officers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. §§ 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.Horner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

   "text": "FERGUSON, St. Louis (CNN) — Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown’s shooting death?The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson police on August 9, the man’s attorney told CNN.In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots — a cluster of six, followed by four.“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” the man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN’s Don Lemon. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.The attorney said she learned of the man’s recording late last week from a mutual friend.“I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,” Blumenthal said.CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.The meaning of the pauseIt’s difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'”Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown’s death.Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown’s body.Key witness speaks outFerguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience storeshortly before the shooting.And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police has put Johnson’s credibility in question.In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.Johnson said Monday night he doesn’t understand why some are questioning his credibility.“I see they bring up my past, my history, but it’s not like it’s a long rap sheet,” Johnson told Lemon. “This one incident shouldn’t make me a bad person.”",

Gold will be even more expensive.According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine’s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr’s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don’t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.As for shipping date, iGen.fr’s sources say the Apple Watch is still on track for a February 2015 release date.

Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests. Under the de Blasio administration's planned changes to the city's marijuana policy, those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons, but avoid a trip to the police station. The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities, as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year.The de Blasio administration is still working out the details, such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest, and some are already unhappy with the proposed change. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases, said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities.\"In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,\" Thompson explained. \"By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.\"In other words, don't expect the debate about how NYPD officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon.",

With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald’s? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?",

The ad says that it is looking for a dev to join eBay’s New Technology Group, which operates out of Portland with over 200 engineers.According to the ad, the ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app.” That seems to indicate that whatever presence the eBay app has on the Apple Watch, it will tie into the core iPhone app.What kind of functionality will the eBay Apple Watch app have? That’s up for speculation, although an alert app that lets you know when you’re about to be outbid, when your items have sold, and when a new watched search term pops up on the world’s largest internet auction site are all a good bet.",

The officials said it is unclear whether this was an actual attempt to rejoin the Taliban militants in Afghanistan.\"We're closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat\" from the attempted communication, a senior U.S. official said. The official could not say exactly how the former prisoner tried to reach the Taliban.The five Taliban militants, including two top leaders, were released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in May. As part of the deal that led to Bergdahl's release, they had to remain in Qatar under a one-year travel ban set to end in June.The militant who tried to reconnect with the Taliban had \"several phone calls\" with family members in Afghanistan, a senior official told NBC. There was no indication the calls, monitored by security officials, involved any \"threatening activity or planning,\" the official added.Nevertheless, the U.S. will try to have restrictions placed on out-of-country calls though the prisoners are allowed to communicate with relatives and other visitors in Qatar.Bergdahl was reportedly captured by the Haqqani terrorist network in Pakistan after he left a remote outpost in June 2009 and held for five years. Bergdahl could be charged with desertion.",

   "text": "Border Patrol agents detain immigrants who crossed from Mexico into the United States near McAllen, Texas, June 27, 2014. The state’s Rio Grande Valley has been the epicenter of a surge illegal immigration in recent months.  Molly Hennessy-Fiske/Los Angeles Times / MCTThe Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said that the assertion that ISIS-affiliated terrorists were arrested while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is “categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.”But the vice president of the largest union representing Border Patrol agents told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that DHS — which oversees the Border Patrol — is incorrect. And he said, the incident highlights the need for more funding for the Border Patrol,“I haven’t been able to outright confirm that it happened, but from what I have heard it sounds very credible,” said Shawn Moran, the vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents some 17,000 Border Patrol employees, “From what people have read to me, from what they say they have seen in documents, it seems pretty legit.”Moran admitted he had not seen the document himself. He added that he did not know the name of the official who prepared the report, or what agency did that official work for, but that his “instincts told” him the official was with the Border Patrol. He also declined to tell BuzzFeed News who had told him about the report in the first place.When asked what would be the appropriate response to the alleged incident, Moran said that the Border Patrol needs more funding and more people to do its job and prevent ISIS from entering the U.S. again.A spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss Moran’s specific statements, but insisted that “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”Moran’s statements Thursday followed allegations from two Republican lawmakers who told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured.The persistence of these rumors may stem from the arrests in September of four people with suspected ties to terrorism that were later found to be unfounded, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a speech Thursday.“Four individuals were arrested, their supposed link to terrorism was thoroughly investigated and checked, and in the end amounted a claim by the individuals themselves that they were members of the Kurdish Worker’s Party – an organization that is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq,” said Johnson. “Nevertheless, these individuals have been arrested for unlawful entry, they are detained, and they will be deported.”Reports that terrorists affiliated with Islamist groups have tried to enter the United States through the southern border have circulated around the web for months, even before ISIS became a household term.In July, for example, members of a volunteer armed militia told Breitbart News they were concerned because they had found what they thought was a “Muslim Prayer Rug” in the Arizona desert.Thus far, the threat embodied by that alleged rug has failed to materialize.",

   "text": "It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.lRelated Pope Francis prays in Istanbul's Blue MosqueNATION & WORLDPope Francis prays in Istanbul's Blue MosqueSEE ALL RELATED\t8The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, \"one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.\"\"There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,\" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.cComments@franniescarp In contrast to yours...J. PAUL GETTY'S EARAT 7:10 PM DECEMBER 13, 2014ADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\t6The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.Religion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said \"The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'\"The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.Asked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, \"The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.\"In his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying \"the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God.\" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.WHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures \"it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.\"The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were \"called to eternity.\"Reuters",

   "text": "WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a \"porous\" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.\"Those of us in public office, and in the media –- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,\" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that \"at least\" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said \"is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq.\" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)On Ebola, Johnson said the government is \"heavily engaged\" and is \"enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.\"\"We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,\" he said.Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.\"We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,\" he said.Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a \"setback,\" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.\"In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,\" he said. \"Put simply, it’s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -– and people know that.\"",

   "text": "As a series of ex-soldiers come forward to criticize Brian Williams for his ‘stolen valor’ Iraq war story, it is being reported that top level executives at NBC News had known the tale was fake and had been begging the newscaster for years to stop repeating it.Williams is at a center of a media firestorm after he was found out for embellishing an old war story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade during the Iraq war in 2003.The newscaster acted swiftly on Wednesday night to attempt to diffuse the situation by apologizing during his Nightly News show, but since then a series of ex-soldiers have come forward to criticize Williams ‘half-hearted’ apology.Brian Williams is at the center of a media firestorm over his embellished war story and now it transpires that NBC News executives - and Tom Brokaw - had known for years that the story was falseTo make matters worse there are also now reports that senior executives at NBC News, including legendary anchor Tom Brokaw who Williams replaced in 2004, knew the story was false.‘Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,’ an insider told the New York Post.Now Brokaw, 74, has had it and wants Williams fired, the Post claims.Senior executives had in the past asked Williams to stop telling the story in public, reports Variety.Despite his credibility being called into question, Williams still took the anchor’s seat for his Nightly News broadcast on Thursday evening but unlike on Wednesday he didn't address the issue during the broadcast.'Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report,' said the source.Retraction: NBC anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as he claimed in a broadcast on Friday, picturedHowever a separate source says that isn't going to happen. 'He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,' said the source.On Thursday the pilot of the army chinook that was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades told the Omaha World-Herald that he had contacted NBC News not long after their initial broadcast. Don Helus said he saw Williams’ initial report not long after its original broadcast after someone emailed him a clip.NBC’s Tom Brokaw introduced the report with the words: 'Our colleague Brian Williams is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call in the skies over Iraq.'Helus said he contacted Williams’ producer and asked for a retraction, but didn't get a reply.'My crew was a little upset about that - somebody trying to make a claim to inflate their career,' Helus said.Williams was forced to apologize on air and on Facebook on Wednesday and admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter that was hit, but had been traveling in a separate aircraft more than half an hour behind that landed without incident.'He was actually on my aircraft and we came in behind [the other helicopter] about 30-45 minutes later,' Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Miller, the flight engineer on the helicopter that carried the journalists, wrote on Facebook after NBC shared a link to Williams' story.Williams pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack: In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error'He had the audacity to tell me the whole thing was like 'Saving Private Ryan' and that the whole army would be out looking for him. I called him an idiot in front of his camera crew and he didn't come back to my bird for the next three days.'Pate Butler, another soldier, confirmed on Facebook: 'He flew with the Savannah birds in a totally different flight. Never was shot at. That aircraft was out of Germany and we were all in that flight.'Lance Reynolds, another soldier who had actually been on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit, also lashed out at Williams on Facebook.'Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft,' he wrote. 'I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened.'Then I remember you guys taking back off in a different flight of Chinooks from another unit and heading to Kuwait to report your 'war story' to the Nightly News.'The whole time we were still stuck in Iraq trying to repair the aircraft and pulling our own Security.'Speaking to Stars and Stripes, Reynolds recalled how he had been aboard the helicopter when it was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.The damaged Chinook made a rolling landing at an Iraqi airfield, skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the desert. Reynolds and other crew members were unhurt.Called out: Lance Reynolds, left, and Pate Butler, right, who were both part of the crews flying that day, said that Williams had not been aboard their damaged helicopter and expressed their anger at his liesAnger: The day after Williams' report, Reynolds responded to the story on NBC NIghtly News' Facebook and said that he remembered things rather differentlyAnother man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response''It was something personal for us that was kind of life-changing for me,' he told Stars and Stripes.'I know how lucky I was to survive it. It felt like a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn't deserve to participate in.'When Williams approached him and took photos of the damaged aircraft, Reynolds said he dismissed the level of danger because he didn't want his wife to see a news report about it.'I wanted to tell her myself everything was all right before she got news of this happening,' he said.Another man on the downed aircraft, Mike O'Keeffe, said he had long been bothered by Williams' false claims.'Over the years it faded,' he said, 'and then to see it last week it was - I can't believe he is still telling this false narrative.'O'Keeffe added that he was satisfied with Williams' apology and didn't want to push the issue any further or 'kick the guy when he is down'.Other soldiers have accused Williams of being misleading in his apology and continuing to imply details that are false.Denial: Williams denied that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor' in a message he posted on WednesdaySince the 2003 incident, Williams' Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC's Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.'Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a 'flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters'.'Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours.'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,' he recalled.By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.''The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote.'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.'The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,' he told Letterman.Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now 'the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.'For example, army flight crews told Stars and Stripes that Williams implied he was flying with the same company that the downed helicopter belonged to - but he was actually flying with a different company in a different direction, and only linked to the unit by radio.He also suggested that his aircraft was forced to land because of the attack, but soldiers said it was landed due to deteriorating weather conditions.After Williams' apology, there were cries for him to be terminated.'Brian Williams has to go,' Brent Bozell, the founder and president of the Media Research Center, wrote on Twitter. 'NBC's credibility is completely shot.'The Nightly News anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire.He repeated his old war story on Friday when he presented a segment about a public tribute at a hockey game in New York for Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, a retired soldier who had provided security for the grounded helicopters.During the report, Williams went further and said that the aircraft he was on had actually been hit - and the soldiers expressed their anger on Facebook afterwards.'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.'On the Nightly News broadcast on Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him.'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize,' he said.In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error.'I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,' he wrote.'Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area - and the fog of memory over 12 years - made me conflate the two, and I apologize.'Williams went on to strenuously deny that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor'.'I was and remain a civilian journalist covering the stories of those who volunteered for duty. This was simply an attempt to thank Tim, our military and Veterans everywhere -- those who have served while I did not.'All the credit: After his apology, Twitter users joked about Williams inserting himself in other historic eventsOne of the top trending topics on Twitter on Wednesday night was #BrianWilliamsMisremembers.'#BrianWilliamsMisremembers and then I said look Woodward you and Bernstein are in way over your head,time to follow a real man..lets do this,' tweeted one person.'And I just knew we could make a better portable music player. Called it the iPod.' #BrianWilliamsMisremembers,' wrote another.Since the 2003 incident, Williams' Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC's Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land.

   "text": "The man who scaled the White House fence this month actually ran through the building into the East Room, much farther than the Secret Service initially disclosed.The intruder overpowered a Secret Service officer posted near the door before penetrating deep into the mansion’s main floor, the Washington Post reported:An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The female officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through.

He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.The White House fence-jumper made it through the North Portico doors (top) and into the East Room (far right).

   "text": "Reasons cited for his mysterious disappearance range from ill health through an addiction to cheese to him being placed under house arrest.Now the latest explanation for Kim Jong Un's conspicuous absence is that he has simply injured his leg.  A source with access to the secretive North's leadership today insisted the leader is in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3. The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrestHe IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. 'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.'Kim Jong Un is in total control,' said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked 'the Marshal' for his support during the competition.Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.'Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,' he said.",

   "text": "US drones are being flown over Isil's Syrian \"capital\" for the first time as part of a drive by America to target Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the jihadist group's elusive leader.Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa have captured photo and video footage of remotely-piloted planes, which Western weapons experts have identified as American Predators, the same drones used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists.The US has not publicly stated that it is flying drones over Syria, and the sightings over Raqqa are the first indication that it is doing so.The sightings are the clearest indication that President Barack Obama has dramatically changed his policy, aggressively stepping up reconnaissance of Isil positions as the US works to assemble an international coalition to fight the jihadists.That diplomatic effort was given a major boost on Monday when Iraq's parliament finally voted to approve a new government aimed at winning broad support against Isil, with Haider al-Abadi as prime minister.Mr Abadi, a member of Iraq's Shia majority, whose candidacy was supported by the US and other western powers, had promised to include members of the Sunni minority as well as Kurds within his government. The attempt to heal sectarian rifts is seen as vital to undermining Isil's appeal in the Sunni heartlands, where disaffection with the previous Shia-dominated government assisted the extremist Islamist group in its rise.Mr Obama immediately called Haider al-Abadi, the new prime minister, and urged him to move quickly to address \"the legitimate grievances\" of Iraq's disenchanted Sunnis.John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said the formation of the unity government was \"a major milestone\" for Iraq.MPs in Baghdad also voted to approve three senior figures in the largely ceremonial role of deputy presidents: Nouri al-Maliki, ousted as prime minister in July, Osama al-Nujeifi, a Sunni and former parliament speaker, and Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia politician who refused to join the last government.But the all-important posts of interior and defence ministers would be filled over the next week, Mr Abadi told MPs.In the battle against Isil, the Pentagon told the Telegraph on Monday that it had \"not yet conducted any strikes against targeted individuals\", but refused to rule out the possibility that it was using drones for surveillance.The US is trying to pinpoint the location of Baghdadi, the jihadist who has declared himself the caliph of captured territory in Iraq and Syria that is the size of Britain, and ruler of its eight million inhabitants.Several residents of Raqqa and jihadists from Isil have captured pictures of a white drone circling overhead, reporting that it flew low over the city for most of Friday and again on Saturday.Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, an anti-Isil activist in Raqqa who posted pictures of the drone, told The Telegraph he had first seen it on Friday. \"It flew over the city for about three hours, from noon until 3pm,\" said Mr Raqqawi, who uses a pseudonym to protect his identity.Mr Raqqawi also reported seeing it on Saturday at the same time that other residents posted news of the sightings online.Experts said they believed the aircraft was an unarmed MQ-1 Predator on a reconnaissance flight. Aaron Stein, an associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said it could be identified by its \"distinct downward facing V-shaped tail\".Mr Stein said that the photographs indicated the drone was unarmed. \"The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery - and possibly signals intelligence - of Islamic State positions in the group's most important stronghold.\"Killing Baghdadi would be a major coup for the US president, who has been widely criticised for not taking tough enough action against Isil.Its impact on the jihadist group is less certain, however: Baghdadi sits at the apex of an elaborate hierarchy, with a \"cabinet\" of deputies who manage the group's military operations and domestic governance.In the event of his death, power would probably transfer to his deputy, Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, a former commander in Saddam Hussein's military who is in charge of Isil's Iraqi territory.In July Baghdadi made a surprise appearance in Mosul, Iraq's second city, where he led men in prayers at the city's Great Mosque, but he rarely shows himself publicly and little is known about his whereabouts since then.Raqqa, a key city in Isil's embryonic \"state\", would need to be scrutinised closely in any hunt for Baghdadi.Mr Obama would be required personally to order a strike against the Isil leader, weighing the advantages of his death against the risk of civilian casualties, but Aki Peritz, a former CIA counter-terrorism analyst, predicted he would do so if the opportunity arose.\"The US is already exerting lethal force against the Islamic State. If it had the opportunity to take its top dog off the battlefield once and for all, the US would pull the trigger,\" Mr Peritz said.The US president is due to give a speech on Wednesday preparing the American public for a campaign against Isil tha officials believe could extend beyond Mr Obama's remaining two years in office.In an interview with NBC, Mr Obama said the US would fight Isil in a manner \"similar to the kinds of counter-terrorism campaigns that we've been engaging in consistently over the last five, six, seven years.\"He has put drone strikes at the heart of America's global struggle against jihadist groups. Last week the US announced it had killed the leader of Somalia's al-Shabaab terror group.",

The Daily Mail added:Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.\"Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson.",

Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me,\" the boy, a second-grader, told Omsk TV and Radio Company.Electric shock changed the boy's life.

   "text": "Comcast allegedly pulled strings to get one of their customers fired from his job at a prestigious accounting firm after he complained about billing issues and false charges. The former Comcast customer, identified only as \"Conal,\" told his story to Consumerist, the site whose readers have named Comcast \"the worst company in America\" two years running.Conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges: Bills sometimes didn't show up, and he was charged for equipment that was never activated, or that he didn't actually have. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. Instead, things got significantly more hellish in October of last year.According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway.But, as an accountant by trade, he had no problem documenting every billing error and overcharge, and he brought them in as a spreadsheet when he dropped off the unwanted DVRs, modems, and other equipment.Even then, Conal says, he wasn't able to get his money back. Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February.And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job. Per Consumerist:On Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast's customer service, which hadn't been of any help in the year he'd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company's Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.He describes that callback as \"bizarre,\" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with \"How can I help you?\" Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn't specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that it could take years to reform, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint.Comcast did blame Conal, though. Consumerist again:At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.The creepiest part is that, although he was allegedly fired for throwing around the name of his powerful employer—who, surprise, happens to do business with Comcast—Conal swears he never told anyone at Comcast where he worked. He believes they just went the extra mile to look him up online and contact his company—because Comcast cares.Comcast has confirmed at least one part of the story: In a letter to Conal's lawyer, who is considering filing suit against the cable provider, Comcast's lawyer said the company did contact Conal's job.Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer \"is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn\" about his customer service struggle.It seems that arguing with you on the phone for 20 minutes or trying to talk you into paying fees you know are fradulent is nowhere near the worst thing Comcast can inflict on you, the customer.They can apparently also wreck your life in ways that have nothing to do with your cable or internet services.Really looking forward to Comcast becoming basically the only cable provider in America![h/t Consumerist, Photo: Mr. T in DC/Flickr]",

Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fishHumans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage.When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh.Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish.Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body.Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong.If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions.Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated.He was treated at the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China.Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections.Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm.While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,.This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician.Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor.'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.'Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream.This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain.Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infectionsEating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream - and can be fatal",

   "text": "Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.",

It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. “We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that.

The concern is that radical Islamist groups will use the planes to mark the anniversary of the deadly 9/11 attacks, according to alleged intelligence reports disseminated within the U.S. government.Reports that Islamist militias have seized the jetliners come just weeks before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. … We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,” one official reportedly told the Washington Free Beacon.The aircraft were reportedly stolen in August after Islamists took control of the Tripoli International Airport. It was later reported that 11 commercial jetliners were missing.On Sept. 11, 2012, four Americans were killed during a terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. At first, the Obama administration blamed the attack on a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim YouTube video.When pressed by the Free Beacon, a “senior State Department counterterrorism official” refused to comment on reports of stolen jetliners in Libya. Another State Department told the online publication, “We can’t confirm that.”It was also reported on Tuesday that Islamic State militants beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff. Just as they did when they murdered photojournalist James Foley, the terrorists reportedly uploaded a video showing the gruesome execution.More from Fox News:Read the full report here.",

   "text": "Breitbart Texas reports:An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.An Examiner.com article seems troubled by this.This, though, is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in America. El-badawi is right that Catholics have long gone to Catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage. Orthodox Jews have long gone to Jewish religious courts (such a court is called a “beth din”) both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes. Some Protestants sometimes do the same; 1 Corinthians 6:1 is often interpreted as calling for that.There are three ways in which these tribunals’ decisions have practical effect.1. Parties’ respect for the system: Religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious law. For instance, a Catholic who doesn’t get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry, even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment, simply because he feels that God wants him to follow the church’s teachings and decisions.2. Social pressure: Would observant Muslims feel pressured to abide by a sharia tribunal’s ruling, when that will affect how their coreligionists, business partners, neighbors, and family members perceive them? You bet. Would Orthodox Jews feel the same? You bet, and I expect that Christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same reaction. For an interesting, but rare, case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so, see Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y (9th Cir. 1987). (I think that, even in the absence of the Free Exercise Clause that were made in that case, but that might be unavailable in many states following Employment Division v. Smith (1990), a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the Free Speech Clause, see NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982).)Indeed, one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations (not to steal, not to commit adultery, and more). The flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with (stay with a husband who mistreats you, never remarry, and so on). Of course, if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure, then the law can step in to punish the violence, and any explicit threats of violence. But the possibility of such violence in rare cases doesn’t allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other cases.3. The parties could also enter into a binding arbitration agreement, under which they agree that the tribunal’s decision would be enforceable in civil court. Such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration, even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than American law (e.g., English law or French law). And they are also permissible for religious arbitration.There are interesting questions about whether an arbitral decision is enforceable in secular American court if it applies substantive or procedural rules that discriminate based on race, religion or sex. I discuss this a bit in this post, and the comments to it are also much worth reading. But according to the Breitbart Texas article, El-badawi says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding arbitrations; rather, their decisions are followed — when they are followed — as a result of the parties’ acquiescence and community pressure. As a result, these interesting questions don’t arise here.Religious communities have long had the right to use standard American contract law — coupled with the standard American liberty to exert social pressure on your family members, friends, neighbors and business partners — to have religious decisionmakers decide disputes. That’s especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community members’ own religious feelings, or by social pressure. But that can also be so, subject to some limitations, when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration (which, again, doesn’t seem to be in play with the Texas Islamic tribunal).The remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law is leaving the community (or the religion). That is of course often very hard, for personal and economic reasons. It’s hard for Muslims. It’s hard for Orthodox Jews (and especially groups such as the Satmar Hasidim). It’s hard for Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Amish, and members of lots of other groups. But that’s a necessary aspect of American social and religious freedom.",

Opposition leader Tom Mulcair praised his \"heroism\".Mr Vickers took charge of security on Parliament Hill - a collection of government buildings overlooking the Ottawa River - in 2006, after a 29-year career in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.He was an experienced officer, reaching the rank of chief superintendent, but he is not usually armed.So when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau charged through the front doors of parliament he reportedly had to return to his office to open the lockbox where he kept his handgun.The attacker had already shot a security guard in the leg in an exchange of gunfire and had run down the Hall of Honour towards the library, where he took cover in an alcove next to Mr Vickers' office.Mr Vickers reportedly emerged, threw himself to the ground to present a smaller target, and shot the assailant three times.It was the first time he had ever shot anyone, a family member told local media.\"He always put his nation and his community first and foremost,\" his brother John said.\"We're just tremendously relieved he's OK and very, very proud of him and what he had to endure today.\"Video images showed Mr Vickers calmly walking back to his office, his automatic pistol still in his hand at his side.He is said to have entered a nearby conference room where Conservative MPs had been holed up to reassure them: \"I put him down.\"\"Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers,\" Justice Minister Peter MacKay said in a Twitter message.Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino also said he was \"profoundly grateful\" to Mr Vickers and to security forces for their \"selfless act of keeping us safe\".One senator called him a hero while reporters heaped praise on him for his quick actions that \"saved lives\".\"Remind me to hug Kevin Vickers the next time I see him,\" said Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Kady O'Malley.In a statement, the humble officer said he was \"very touched\" by all the attention but said it must be shared with his \"remarkable security team\".\"Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage.

The letter reminds parents that \"the urge to create is equally strong in all children...boys and girls.\" Take a look:Source: ImgurThe letter was first posted by Reddit user fryd_, who said he unearthed the letter \"with his niece and nephew at their Grandma's house\" in a box with a \"blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house.\"If real, this letter perfectly aligns with Lego's history of egalitarian advertising that hasn't pigeonholed its products to just boys. Source: Kinja-imgSource: ThesocietypagesBut like everything on the Internet, the legitimacy is being questioned. The writers at iO9 are less skeptical, pointing to the letter's use of Lego's 1970s logo, which is slightly different than the one used presently. As for further evidence for authenticity, Lego's ads in that era used similar fonts. Lastly, there's a German version of the letter that reads almost identical to this one.The evidence is convincing that it's legitimate and it would be a bizarre thing to fake. It's a compelling statement to make for the 1970s — and more importantly, it still holds true today.Mic has reached out to Lego for comment on this letter.

   "text": "International experts have raised doubts as to whether a 12m-wide (40ft) crater near the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, was caused by a meteorite.Nicaraguan officials announced on Sunday that a \"small meteorite\" had come down near the airport.But Nasa scientists say the fact that no-one reported seeing a fireball in the sky would suggest it was caused by something else.So far no meteorite fragments have been found in the crater.'Like a bomb'Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time on Saturday and reported a burning smell.A crater 12m wide and more than 5m deep was later found near Managua's international airport.An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was \"convinced it was a meteorite\" which caused the impact.But Head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office Bill Cooke said that \"for something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball, and nothing was reported\".Managua has a population of 1.2 million people and many residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling a shock wave.Victor Gutierrez, a mechanic who lives less than a kilometre from the site of the crater said that he \"heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong''.`But he stressed that he \"didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.\"Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said it was possible nobody was looking up at the sky when the event took place close to midnight.'Alternative explanations'Nasa's Bill Cooke estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of \"roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT [explosive material]\".In his blog on the NASA website, he said that a meteor capable of such force would have created a fireball visible over a wide area.On Sunday Ineter scientist Jose Millan had insisted that \"all the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event\".\"We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,\" he added.Government spokeswoman and First Lady Rosario Murillo said the crater was created by a \"relatively small meteorite\" that \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth\".But Nasa asteroid expert Don Yeomans said the impact felt in Managua \"was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of [asteroid] 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated\".Mr Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to \"someone out blowing things up\".Nicaraguan officials said on Sunday that they would invite international experts to investigate the event further.",

   "text": "Syrian activists claim militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized earlier this week a cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish fighters battling the extremist group.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the militants seized at least once cache, but may have seized more, the Associated Press reported.The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to ISIS, the agency said.The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. (Photo courtesy: YouTube screengrab) The Observatory, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.The militant group has been trying to seize the town for more than a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air. (Photo courtesy: YouTube screengrab) On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said, “Team USA.”But the badly-aimed weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The ISIS militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people on Tuesday. (Photo courtesy: YouTube screengrab) Activists with the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) and the Britain-based Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.The air strikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamist rebel groups for control of the area.Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting air strikes against ISIS militants elsewhere in Syria.(With the Associated Press)",

   "text": "Sex-selecting abortions are nothing new. They happen all the time in China, for example. While they undoubtedly happen in the United States, people don’t brag about them. At least they didn’t.It’s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website “Injustice Stories,” a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy. Then, after making that declaration, claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that.Lana, who only uses her first name, appears to be a child of privilege. She boasts of involvement in “fighting for women’s rights” being all-consuming, “even to the point of eschewing a career.” Yet that lack of a career hasn’t stopped her from travelling to “many different places” to continue that “fight.She tells the story of a flight to an Occupy Wall Street event in San Francisco where she screamed “Assault” because the man sitting next to her said “B******* like you need to learn their place.”Putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside, Lana then demanded to be moved to another seat. That’s when she was told the only empty seats were “both back in economy.” At which point she demanded the man be moved.When the flight attendants came running, one of whom was male, they refused to force the man to move because he hadn’t done anything. Lana, regretfully, relented and, in tears, moved herself.The encounter left her “having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.”That flight, according to Lana, left her forever changed. “By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause,” she wrote.Lana was pregnant at the time, and thought she “had a good idea” who the father, or as she puts it, “the donator” happened to be. She was convinced she was having a girl because, well, she wanted a girl. Or at least a baby with a vagina, the “gender” part would be up to the child. “I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become,” she writes.After researching all-girl daycares and schools with the plan to make sure that “No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names,” Lana got horrible news from her doctor – her baby had a penis.She spent the next two days in fit of crying rage. How could this happen to her? She says, “My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden.”Within a few days she had aborted the baby. “My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong,” Lana claims. “I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good.”Lana informs readers that she is now the mother of “a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother.”She ends her post with:I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.The backlash was immediate, and harsh. Lana, much to her shock, was on the receiving end of negative comments and even death threats.At the request of the editors of the website, Lana returned to answer critics. She was as unrepentant the second time as she was the first.",

   "text": "The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com.Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times.And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous.For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido.But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers.Scroll down for videoDiane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube accountDeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5mThe Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de JesusAre these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensationSeen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector videoThe couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records.Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour.DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked.Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida.Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both madeThe DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audienceThe videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo themeMaribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videosIn the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seenThis still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million timesDeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTubeThe user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers.When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live.Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy SummersDeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right)DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida homeThe 29-year-old once made risqué videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlersIt is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channelThe branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video postsLike others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count.In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighboursThe entrance to the gated community where DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videosDeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a yearDisney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquartersBut the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando.Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy.According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel BarretoMs Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys CollectorBut when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried awaySome of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it.It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biographyDaily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls.",

   "text": "Apple will offer a low power mode on Apple Watch to help boost it through longer days, according to a new report that also takes a stab at dispelling rumors that the company may have elected to all some long-rumored sensors last minute.With the exception of Pebble products, most current and upcoming smartwatches - including the Apple Watch - will last no more than a day on a single charge. To help mitigate this issue, Apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the Apple Watch called Power Reserve, according to the New York Times. It's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time, helping to extend the watch's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible. The function is similar in concept to the Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0, which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use.Apple previously stated that the Watch's battery should last only a normal day, requiring a fresh charge at night. Although standard among smartwatches, the issue has created controversy, since many had been hoping Apple would solve the smartwatch industry's battery woes with its inaugural effort.The report also notes that despite some recent claims to the contrary, Apple's decision to abandon some advanced health tracking features came over 18 months ago, rather than at the last minute. Early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable. Instead, the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors, once again mirroring some competing smartwatches.The Times also highlights some of the challenges that faced the Apple Watch's development cycle, noting that Apple not only encountered technical difficulties in achieving its ideal design but was also forced to battle the loss of key engineers, some of whom were poached by Google-owned home automation outfit Nest Labs. Among them was Bryan James, who became an Engineering vice president at Nest early last year.Chief among some of the later challenges was keeping a tight lid on secrecy surrounding the product while simultaneously deploying evaluation units into the real world, for which Apple engineers created dummy casing, including some resembling Samsung smartwatches.Apple is due to reveal more details about the Watch at a San Francisco press event on March 9th. AppleInsider will be offering live coverage of the event as it progresses.",

   "text": "An alleged bug in iOS 8 appears to be deleting documents stored in iCloud Drive without the user's permission.Discovered by MacRumors after complaints surfaced from users of the blog site's forums, the bug is triggered by the option to Reset All Settings.Found in the Reset screen under the General category in Settings for iOS 8, the Reset All Settings option is supposed to simply reset your iOS settings but leave your data and media untouched. Yet several forum users say that's not the case as certain iCloud documents also vanished after they reset all settings.Based on user comments, the bug seems to be specific to documents from iWork apps, such as Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, MacRumors said. One user reported that his iWork documents were deleted after resetting all settings, but other data files remained in iCloud.\"HELP,\" one user wrote. \"Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.\"\"I just had this happen to me,\" another forum user wrote. \"I had a bit of weird behaviour on my iPad, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just reset all settings. For the hell of it, I did it on my iPhone as well. ALL DOCUMENTS LOST! How on earth does resetting settings (with a clear notice that data will not be lost) wipe out iCloud drive? It's embarassing.\"Apple's Time Machine feature is supposed to automatically back up your files so you can restore any that are lost. A couple of users said they checked Time Machine but were unable to retrieve the lost iCloud Drive files. However, a third person reported success with Time Machine, at least running the beta of OS X Yosemite. Several of the affected users say they've contacted Apple support personnel, who are investigating the issue.MacRumors ran its own test on the bug and reported the following:In our own testing, using \"Reset All Settings\" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to Google Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive, and other cloud-based storage services. Beyond just syncing your files between your iOS devices and iCloud, you can directly store and retrieve documents and other files on iCloud Drive just as you can store and retrieve them locally.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The initial assumption based on the report is that Detroit locals may have stolen it!All initial reports point to Bleeding Cool as the primary source of the report. They did not give any specific details:\"The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of 'Batman Vs. Superman' has gone missing, believed stolen.Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.\"The website is one of the known super hero movie sites and has been accurate in some of their scoops. However, there is no way to determine the accuracy of this claim except through the police.One of the local radio stations affiliated with CBS Detroit Local did just that. The result along with CBS Detroit's report:\"Does this person - if the rumor is true (we don't know how credible the source is) - think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?If I see the Batmobile driving around anywhere I am taking photos. Even funnier: Could you imagine getting pulled over for going too slow in this car? No way right?How would the cops catch it with all the Bat devices that come standard? Does Alfred come to your rescue? Is the Batcave set in the GPS? If so, you would be safe from the cops, I presume...Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn't heard about this, but were looking into it).\"We'll keep you posted on further developments. In the meantime, be on the lookout for the Batmobile. It looks like this.",

   "text": "A mother has been accused of cannibalism after she was allegedly found biting her newborn baby’s arm.The woman, named locally as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua, was found trying to eat the child while in a hospital ward in Shenzhen, southern China, recovering from the birth.Luckily a nurse saw the woman with her teeth locked around her son and raised the alarm.The nurse, named as Liu Tianlun, attempted to prise the woman off the baby but the mother refused to let her child go.She was eventually sedated and extracted from the baby.A hospital spokesman said: ‘It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite.‘Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart.‘After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.’The mother is believed to have been living on the street after being thrown out by her mother-in-law despite being pregnant.She is believed to have been surviving on the streets for a number of weeks before going into labour and being taken to hospital.Hospital staff are deciding whether to give the newborn back to his mother.An investigation into the incident is ongoing.",

   "text": "The Lebanese army detained a wife and daughter of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as they crossed from Syria nine days ago, security officials said on Tuesday, in a move seen as likely to put pressure on the Islamist chief.The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source.The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported she had been detained in co-ordination with “foreign intelligence.”A Lebanese security source said the arrest was “a powerful card to apply pressure” in negotiations to secure the release of 27 members of the Lebanese security forces captured by Islamic militants in August near the Syrian border – a view shared by other Lebanese officials who confirmed the arrest.A senior Lebanese security official said al-Baghdadi’s wife had been traveling with one of their daughters, contradicting earlier reports that it was his son. DNA tests were conducted to verify it was al-Baghdadi’s child, the official said.They were detained in northern Lebanon. Investigators were questioning her at the Lebanese defense ministry.There was no immediate reaction from Islamic State websites, although some of the group’s supporters rejected the report.Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics said the arrest indicated that the American-led coalition seems to have solid intelligence in Syria and Iraq.”“I talked to a few people who told me this was a coordinated arrest between American intelligence services and the Lebanese army,” he told Reuters.“If I were Abu Bakr Baghdadi, I would be very anxious that they are getting very close,” he said. “This is a development … that is very alarming for ISIS, in particular the top leadership.”Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaeda-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.A source with contacts with Iraqi intelligence said the captured woman was an Iraqi wife of al-Baghdadi’s, but could not confirm the name. There was cooperation between Iraqi and Lebanese authorities leading up to her capture, the source said.Al-Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.Islamic State has declared a caliphate and seized wide areas of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon’s neighbor to the east.The Lebanese security forces have cracked down on the group’s sympathizers and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the borders with Syria. They have arrested over the past few months dozens of Islamic militants suspected of staging attacks to expand Islamic State influence in Lebanon.A U.S.-led alliance is seeking to roll back Islamic State’s territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to “degrade and ultimately destroy” al-Baghdadi’s group, which is seeking to reshape the Middle East according to its radical vision of Islam.An Islamic State fighter denied that al-Baghdadi’s wife had been arrested. “I have checked with our leaders and they said it was false news. The Lebanese are lying,” he said from inside Syria.Spillover from the Syrian conflict has repeatedly jolted neighboring Lebanon. Militants affiliated to the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and Islamic State are demanding the release of Islamists held by the Lebanese authorities in exchange for the captured members of the Lebanese security forces.The United States is offering $10-million for information leading to the location, arrest, or conviction of al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarai.Al-Baghdadi called for attacks against the rulers of Saudi Arabia in a speech purported to be in his name last month.He said his self-declared caliphate was expanding in Saudi Arabia and four other Arab countries and called for “volcanoes of jihad” the world over in the speech released on Nov. 13.A CV of al-Baghdadi published on social media in July by Islamic State sympathizers described him as married but gave no further details.Born in 1971, al-Baghdadi comes from an Iraqi family of preachers and Arabic teachers, according to a biography distributed on Islamist forums that says he studied at the Islamic University in Baghdad.According to U.S. media reports, al-Baghdadi was detained for several years at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq, before becoming head of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, a predecessor to Islamic State, which expanded into Syria in 2013.In June this year, his group named him “caliph for the Muslims everywhere,” and called on all Muslims to pledge allegiance. Although he is rarely pictured, a video released in July showed him preaching in a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul.The Lebanese authorities have also detained the wife of Anas Shirkas, senior Nusra Front leader from Syria, security officials said on Tuesday. They did not identify her.",

She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country’s north.Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.\"This is false propaganda by IS,” Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. \"We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria.\"The Israeli government, which on Sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture, had also stressed that the information was of “dubious credibility,” according to a report by The Times of Israel. “I cannot confirm that [report of Rosenberg’s capture] and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon had reportedly said.",

   "text": "The wife and child of the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (Isil), have been arrested in Lebanon, security officials and Lebanese politicians said on Tuesday.An Iraqi women, identified by local security sources as Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi was detained ten days ago at a checkpoint, along with Baghdadi’s son, north of the Lebanese town of Tripoli, a senior security confirmed to the Telegraph.“She had crossed into Lebanon from Syria. She and her son were travelling on fake passports,” the source said.The boy is said to be no older than 11 years of age.Citing security officials, the Lebanese As-Safir newspaper said the child’s DNA had been tested and showed the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant jihadist group is his father.Baghdadi’s DNA is likely to have been taken by US officials in the American run Camp Bucca prison in Iraq, where he was detained in 2004.The newspaper said the arrests had been made after a tip off from a “foreign” intelligence agency, that is believed to belong to a Western government.The wife and child are said to be currently being held in the Ministry of National Defence headquarters in Yarze, just outside Beirut.Mrs Dulaimi was one of 138 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Syrian nuns being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.Though Iraqi, Mrs Dulaimi had reportedly detained along with three of her children during a military operation near the Syria capital Damascus.Earlier this year a photograph was circulated online purporting to be of Mrs Dulaimi. It showed a young woman with a pale face, clearly defined cheek bones and large eyes. Her hair is covered in a black hijab.The release of Mrs Dulaimi was repeatedly demanded by the al-Qaeda kidnappers of the nuns, who were captured from a convent in the Syrian Christian town of Maaloula.One source close to the negotiations told the Telegraph that they had “insisted” that without her release negotiations “would not continue”.Mrs Dulaimi’s second detention is likely to be a significant personal blow to Baghdadi and could be used as a bargaining chip against his group, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners and declared a caliphate in territory it has seized in Syria and Iraq.Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.Earlier this year the Telegraph visited the ramshackle neighbourhood of Tobchi in Baghdad, where Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri, spent his early years.A resident who had played football alongside Baghdadi, when they were both part of a team formed by the local mosque, said he had married shortly after completing his doctorate at the Islamic University in Baghdad at the start of the millennium.The resident, who asked not to be named recalled that his wife had given birth to a son within less than a year of the marriage ceremony. His son is now approximately 11 years old, matching the age of the boy reportedly captured in Lebanon.There were some contradicting and unconfirmed reports that the child captured may have been a girl.Syria's civil war has killed more than 200,000 people in less than four years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Thursday.",

We were clearly moments away from its end and we hadn’t been told how long the company’s first wearable will run on a single charge. Expected battery life was a glaring omission in an otherwise impressive parade of features and specs. And after ignoring it completely during the Apple Watch’s onstage debut, the company stalwartly refused comment on it during the device demos that followed.There’s a good reason for that. Sources tell me that Apple isn’t yet happy with the watch’s battery life, which isn’t going to break any industry standards. “It’s about a day right now,” said one, adding that Apple is working on various modifications ahead of the device’s 2015 launch to improve it. Reached for comment, Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris declined to provide an estimate on expected battery life, but said the company expects users will charge their Apple Watches once daily. “There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,” Kerris said. “We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.”And Soil Shorts at Fitbit, Jawbone, Samsung and MotorolaApple CEO Tim Cook on Apple Watch in an all-hands memo to employees: “This is a product which will change what people expect from wearable technology.”BABA BooeyAlibaba kicked off the road show for its initial public offering on Monday, and its IPO order book is already full up.

   "text": "UPDATE: ESPN has confirmed that no such panel will take place, for the love of all that is holy.Domestic abuse, a crime that victimizes 1.3 million women a year according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, is not an issue that men at the NFL seem capable of addressing, discussing, or addressing their discussion. According to the NCADV, \"In 70-80% of intimate partner homicides, no matter which partner was killed, the man physically abused the woman before the murder.\"It's men committing it, men not punishing them for it, men not losing their jobs over mishandling it. The end result has been some of the NFL's worst public relations, ever. But ESPN, a sports network that will stop at nothing to free the NFL of this shame, is about to step in and make it all better with a bold plan: Send in more men.Eleven men, to be exact, who will fill out a panel prior to the Chiefs playing the Patriots tonight on Monday Night Football. The panel will discuss, among other things, domestic abuse and the NFL.Remember, 1.3 million women are victimized by domestic abuse every year, but none of them will be on the panel. Ray Lewis will be, though. As will Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Stuart Scott and Steve Young. Esquire has a proper shaming here.How have some of these guys reacted to Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson's domestic abuce scandals and Roger Goodell's gross mishandling of them?\"Look, the NFL did not create these problems. The people in the NFL created these problems. The players. It’s not the commissioner. It’s not the owners. These kids are given the opportunity to make a lot of money and to play football. Now, if they want to jeopardize that with stupid behavior and doing dumb things, then it’s their fault. Why should the NFL take a black eye for what individuals do?\"--Mike Ditka\"The only thing I'm proud about is the team I played for, they did the right thing. Take them off the field... Because you know what? As a man, that's the only thing we really respect. We don't respect no women. We don't respect no kids. The only thing Roger [Goodell] and them can do, take them off the field because they respect that.\"--Cris Carter“If that (being physically punished) didn’t happen to me along the way I wouldn’t be here with you today. It taught me a lot of learning lessons.”--Keyshawn Johnson“There is no comparison between me and Ray Rice. It’s night and day.”--Ray LewisCarter's praising of the Vikings for heroically deactivating Peterson following his admission that he hit his child with a switch is a bit off, as the team had activated him to play that week. This was followed by intense public outcry and led to the Vikings then rescinding the activation a day and a half later. So yeah, they did the right thing, after enough people complained about them doing the very clearly wrong thing.This is a lot of men who think a lot of things about these issues but they may not possess the eloquence needed to present their points. Although in somebody like Ditka's case, their points are wildly off base anyway. The best type of point we can hope for tonight is \"willful ignorance.\" Why? Because, as Ben Collins writes in his Esquire piece:\"... ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.\"Mostly, though, the issue is this: On a panel choosing to discuss domestic abuse on the national stage, before an NFL football game, ESPN has filled out the roster with their extremely male water-carrying talking heads. And again, Ray freaking Lewis, who is no doubt being counted on for NFL Punishment Analysis and to discuss his long, hard journey back from being implicated in a double homicide to the unveiling of his statue in front of M&T Stadium. Their choice to talk about the issue is likely to be nothing more than further damage control, rather than an enlightening and frank discussion.It will be very difficult to indicate that ESPN cares, and the NFL cares, and that you should care, if ESPN can't even take the issue seriously enough to find at the very least a female majority panel to discuss an issue that touches primarily women.But it's okay, because Roger Goodell went to a domestic abuse call center, where he was very open about his plans to not forget about this issue as fast as he can.\"[Call center CEO Katie] Ray-Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL might put in place for domestic violence.\"Progress.",

   "text": "Islamic State (IS) fighters may have captured weapons airdropped by the US near the Syrian town of Kobane, intended for the Kurdish forces defending it against the jihadists' onslaught. A video posted on YouTube on Tuesday by a group calling itself \"A3maq News\" purports to show airdropped supplies in the hands of the extremist group. The footage shows a masked and armed militant examining a package attached to a parachute. Later, he looks into crates containing various munitions, including RPG rounds and grenades. The video could not immediately be independently verified, but A3maq News has previously posted IS-linked content and the some of the weapons seen in the video appear to match those possessed by Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which supplied the arms.The grenades seen at 1:28 in the video are reported to be German-made. Berlin sent 10,000 grenades to Iraqi Kurdistan in August as part of a consignment of military aid provided to the KRG's peshmerga fighters, according to publicly available German government documents. Additionally, US Central Command confirmed in a statement on Monday that one airdropped bundle had missed its target,. However, CentCom said it had been destroyed in a follow-up airstrike to stop it falling into enemy hands. American C-130 planes delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the KRG to People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters at dawn on Sunday, according to a CentCom statement. The operation was intended to \"enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane,\" CentCom added, using the former name for the Islamic State.YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil told Reuters that the weapons would \"help greatly\" in the fight against IS. \"The military assistance dropped by American planes at dawn on Kobane was good and we thank America for this support,\" he said.Kobane is surrounded on three sides by IS and is bordered to the north by Turkey. The Turkish government has thus far refused repeated requests to open a land corridor allowing humanitarian and military supplies into the town, leading to accusations of tacit complicity in the IS assault on the Kurds, whose struggle for greater autonomy has long been a thorn in Ankara's side. However, on Monday it announced that it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross the border to the town.The airdrops were the first of their kind, but the US launched a series of airstrikes on IS targets in August, then extended operations into Syria in September. American planes have now carried out more than 135 airstrikes against IS in Kobane, according to the Centcom statement, which it says are indicated to have \"slowed ISIL [S] advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions.\"Follow John Beck on Twitter: @JM_Beck",

However the December 2014 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, Guns N' Roses frontman is alive and well.UPDATE 03/12/2014 : This story seems to be false. (read more)Axl Rose death hoax spreads on FacebookRumors of the singer’s alleged demise gained traction on Monday after a ‘R.I.P. Axl Rose’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American singer’s passing:“At about 11 a.m. ET on Monday (December 01, 2014), our beloved singer Axl Rose passed away. Axl Rose was born on February 6, 1962 in Lafayette. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 52-year-old singer, musician and songwriter was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a singer of Axl Rose's stature would be major news across networks.A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (89%) of respondents think those Axl Rose death rumors are not funny anymore.Axl Rose Death Hoax Dismissed Since Singer Is ‘Alive And Well’On Tuesday (December 02) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Axl Rose is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved singer.

The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”",

This year, whether it meant to or not, it may have some big news: 9to5Mac has some new details that say there's a 12-inch MacBook Air with a completely new design, a higher-resolution display, and few of the trappings we've come to expect from a MacBook Air.Here's Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac:Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.According to Gurman's sources, there are a number of other changes as well. The function keys and arrow keys have been redesigned, and the keyboard sits completely edge to edge on the palmrest. It's smaller and narrower, apparently, and the trackpad doesn't have the same clicking feedback. Of course, let's be clear: these are leaks and sources, who are often working with incomplete and occasionally incorrect information. Things also change, a lot, between leaks and release. But also, Mark Gurman has a long history of being right.These photos, too, are not real. They are renderings, guesses as to what the Macbook might be. But if these sources are right, confirming rumors we've been hearing for months and years — of a lighter, thinner, higher-res MacBook Air — 2015 could be a big year for Apple's laptops.",

   "text": "NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California -Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry - ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.”",

   "text": "A propaganda video claiming to show U.S. journalist James Wright Foley kneeling on a mountaintop and making a long anti-U.S. statement, presumably under duress, was posted to YouTube on Tuesday. Foley is standing next to an ISIS militant, who makes some remarks placing the blame for Foley’s death on U.S. President Barack Obama, before appearing to behead Foley with a knife.The video, posted by Furqan Media, an official ISIS outlet, begins with footage of President Obama’s speech announcing his authorization of air strikes against ISIS in northern Iraq, preceded by these words: “Obama authorizes military operation against the Islamic State, effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.” The video, which gives no hint as to where Foley was being held, then shows footage of the recent air strike in northern Iraq, before cutting to the beginning of Foley’s speech.In the statement, during which he remained calm, Foley appeared to date his remarks by referring to recent strikes in Iraq. He specifically mentioned his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force.The militant at Foley’s side started his speech by saying: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” His statement referred to the recent air strikes, and continued: “You’re no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide, so effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership.”Time magazine journalist Steven Sotloff, who has also been missing in Syria since August 2013, was paraded alive toward the end of the video, with the ISIS militant holding him threatening the U.S. president, saying that Sotloff’s life depended on Obama’s next move in Iraq.Foley, a freelance journalist working for the Global Post, went missing near Taftanaz in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012, as he was on his way out of the country. His family and fellow journalists have been campaigning for his release ever since. Foley also spent six weeks in captivity in Libya while reporting on the war there in 2011. Numerous theories were posited for his disappearance, with many surmising that he was no longer alive, or that he was in Syrian state custody.Jihadist forums immediately lit up with gloating posts upon the video’s publication, with exhortations to keep pushing the propaganda via social media. Said one, posting on the Hanein forums: “We must upload the video with a title in both Arabic and English for it to arrive to the American people … Keep uploading the video every minute since YouTube declared war on us you brothers.” Journalists and others, meanwhile, urged people not to share the video.The original video was immediately removed from YouTube for breaching its terms and conditions on violent content, but multiple copies are continuing to pop up.Several others pounced on the fact that Foley was shown in military-style fatigues during a split-screen portion of the video. “Look at minute 2:16, is he a soldier or a journalist!!” said one.",

   "text": "A small furor has erupted over whether a Saudi television station blurred out the image of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in the broadcast of her and President Barack Obama’s meeting with new Saudi King Salman today in Riyadh. Saudi officials deny the claim.The new king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but didn’t acknowledge the first lady during a brief meeting at the funeral for King Abdullah. Barack and Michelle Obama cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral.  Several videos posted on Saudis' Facebook pages obscured Michelle Obama's face. They were removed shortly after they were posted. I captured a screenshot of one such video before it was taken down. The Arab news service Mashahead posted on YouTube a video allegedly taken from the Saudi government television broadcast showing the blurred spot.However,  Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, e-mailed me that \"Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.\" CNN's Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague Nic Robertson, in Riyadh, saw non-blurred images on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without obscuring Michelle Obama’s face. The alleged blurring wasn't the only controversy.  Some Arab media outlets criticized Michelle Obama for wearing a blue dress, rather than a black one. Videos of the short meeting between Salman and President Obama showed the king leaving in the middle of the protocol, abruptly turning around and walking away, in order to go to prayer.After the meeting, Barack Obama and Salman held a bilateral meeting that included Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal and CIA director John Brennan.According to the White House pool report, “Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.” In an interview with CNN before the visit, Obama explained why he was hesitant to press the new king about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes restricting the rights of women.\"Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,\" Obama said.(Updates with comment from Saudi embassy in third paragraph.)To contact the author on this story:Josh Rogin at joshrogin@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor on this story:Tobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.net",

   "text": "One of the best things about the Internet is the speed at which it allows information to be shared. Unfortunately, this means all information -- even false ones like the news about the six-day darkness that would envelop the world in December.The report \"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014\" was published by Huzlers.com. Considering the site labeled itself as offering \"a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief,\" the story should have been taken with a grain of salt at the very least.According to the story, NASA \"confirmed\" that the Earth would be experiencing six days of nearly complete darkness from Dec. 16 to 22. The event would supposedly happen because of a solar storm that would spur enough dust and debris in space that 90 percent of sunlight would be blocked out.NASA head Charles Bolden was said to have made the announcement, asking people to remain calm given a solar storm so bad (the biggest in 250 years!) was going to happen that it would block out the sun for 216 hours.Reporters also apparently \"interviewed\" people to hear what they had to say about the event, with Michael Hearns responding with a \"We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam.\"How people took that response seriously is a mystery.Six days of darkness, if it were to really happen, sounds like a big deal but the story downplays it in the end, noting that officials said that major problems would not arise anyway. A certain Earl Godoy, a NASA scientist, reiterated there would be no problem because the planet could survive on \"artificial light\" during the event.NASA has not made any official statements regarding this six-day period of darkness descending on Earth.The good news is that this means the world will not be falling into darkness for six days in December. The bad news is that people aren't very good at separating what's real from what's not, liking and sharing the story thousands of times since it first came out on Oct. 25.Huzlers.com was also responsible for reports in the past where Tupac Shakur claimed he was alive, Ebola victims rose from the dead, and Floyd Mayweather offered a $1 million annual salary to have someone read everything for him.",

   "text": "A former American soldier from Wisconsin who has become the face of the YPG Kurdish military force in Syria, told UPI Wednesday in an exclusive interview that civilians have been burned in an Islamic State attack, with injuries consistent with chemical weapons.Jordan Matson, 28, a former U.S. Army soldier speaking from Derik, Syria, said his information comes from Walat Omar, the head field doctor in the embattled border town of Kobane, which is encircled by IS militants. Matson and others in the area said the injuries were caused by chemical weapons.\"Since I got the phone calls here in the location... I looked into it myself and after I'd seen pictures from fighters... from Kobane, I contacted the local field doctor on the ground in Kobane and he had sent me many pictures from the hospital,\" Matson said in his first video interview with U.S. media.\"We're trying to get a video camera to Kobane because they don't have one right now to record the injured and show the world proof of what's going on over there. ... We're making more attempts to have more solidified proof for the rest of the world.\"Omar posted photos to Facebook of visible burns that were reportedly sustained in the overnight attack.Matson, a native of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, arrived in Syria last month via Iraq and quickly became the public face of the YPG.\"Someone had to do it,\" he said, laughing.He is more serious in the widely publicized image of him clad in camouflage, a head scarf and carrying a weapon now appearing across YPG's social media accounts. Although the public role \"was thrown on me,\" Matson is quick to add he's happy to play it because the media attention has \"brought light to the situation here.\"Matson says American veterans are \"outraged\" over the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.\"We do not want to see our brothers' lives be for nothing,\" he said. \"So, in the hundreds, veterans are lining up to come over here because if our government won't do anything, we will.\"Matson acknowledged that the recent U.S. airdrops of Iraqi-provided weapons to YPG fighters in Kobane are helpful in the battle against IS, but that more is needed.On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked to explain U.S. support to non-vetted local fighters in Syria.Earnest said that while there is \"limited insight into those particular fighters... the fact is, at this point, they are working hard to defeat ISIL forces that right now are concentrated on this specific community.\"\"So we're going to evaluate each of these circumstances as they come along to look for opportunities to support local fighters against ISIL,\" Earnest said.Matson said YPG needs more weapons and night vision goggles. The Islamic State militants, he said, fight primarily under cover of darkness and engage with YPG within 300 meters.Night vision goggles \"would give us the ability to see them coming, organize our defenses and engage the enemy, and force ISIS to fight us at day because we would have a larger advantage.\"On Tuesday, the YPG launched a recruitment campaign. \"JOIN People's Defense Units/YPG/in Rojava, Syria, SEND TERRORISTS TO HELL and SAVE HUMANITY,\" reads the YPG's 'Lions of Rojava' recruitment message.The page profiles American fighters, including Matson, who have traveled to Syria to join the battle against IS.Matson encouraged his Facebook followers to consider joining the YPG, directing those interested to visit the newly established YPG recruitment page: \"For all those looking to join the YPG... send them a private message. They will explain what you need for your journey and will organize travel arrangements for you. Thank you all for your patience and god bless.\"It's unclear how many Americans are now overseas but Matson said Wednesday there are \"hundreds.\"Neither the U.S. Army nor the Pentagon would comment on the travel of former veterans to Syria.The YPG has identified two other Americans who have joined its defense forces. Brian Wilson of Ohio, and Jeremy Woodard, a former infantryman from Mississippi.Wilson declined to be interviewed.Woodard's brother, Allen, expressed frustration with Jeremy's decision to travel to Syria. In a public Facebook post last month, he wrote:\"I talk to him almost everyday and still don't really understand why the hell he did go over there but he is there now and nothing I can do about it now. I just hope he makes it back fine. I think the military failed him this time. He never got the war and stuff out of him and the VA's mental health didn't keep a watch on him... His reasoning and excuses for going over there just don't make sense at all.\"",

But the rumor is not true, according to the university.A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with “first year.”The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story.The article claimed the school implemented the term “first-year” in everything from its website to orientation workshops.But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy.Anderson said the university uses the term “first-year” because it applies to more students than the term “freshman.”He said the school uses “first-year” to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate.“Elon has done what most schools have done and gone to using ‘first-year’ more frequently because ‘first-year’ encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,” Anderson said. “We still use ‘freshman’ when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.”The student who wrote the original story said she became curious when she was writing a story for the school newspaper and her editor changed the word “freshman” to first-year.”She said she was surprised her story got as much attention as it did and hopes it didn’t put the school in a bad light.Read full story: The Burlington Times-News",

However, Blanco said it would be “irresponsible” without DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were the missing students.Mexico’s Proceso, citing anonymous sources, reported that 20 bodies had been discovered. The Associated Press reports that six pits had been discovered but did not report a body count.The students disappeared after clashing with police during a protest that turned violent. Officials have detained 30 people, including 22 police officers, in the case. Blanco said that a local criminal organization, Los Guerreros Unidos, was connected with the violence and the disappearances.Close to 100,000 Mexicans have been killed or gone missing in drug-related violence since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderon ordered the country’s military to reclaim parts of the country under the influence of drug cartels.[WSJ]",

   "text": "Ignoring the idiotic instances where people intentionally started bending iPhone 6 units in stores just to prove it can be done, Apple did have an iPhone 6 Bendgate problem, which genuinely affected some early buyers. Early reports have shown that the iPhone 6 Plus was more prone to bending than its smaller sibling, with some users explaining why the iPhone 6 Plus can bend in a certain way — apparently the area around the bottom volume button lacks the kind of reinforcement that can prevent bending. However, Apple might have fixed the issue, one Reddit user seems to indicate.Redditor doctorkuddles says that he just purchased an 128GB iPhone 6 Plus that feels different than his wife’s early 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model.“I can’t prove anything. I can only look at my iPhone 6 Plus I got yesterday, and the 6 Plus my wife got on September 20th,” he explains. “We have identical phones minus the GB size (I have 128GB, she has the 16GB) Both are space gray. I started looking at both phones closely.“First difference I noticed is the smoothness on the week one phone compared to the week 6 (?) phone. Completely softer and smoother. The second difference I noted was when I started tapping (‘flicking’) the back and sides of both phones. Right where the previous ‘bends’ were in previous 6 Pluses (above and below the volume rocker), there is a night and day difference in sound,” he adds.doctorkuddles further says he used a stethoscope to listen to the iPhone 6 Plus and found that his 128GB phone sounds “much more dull toned, indicating to me it’s more solid” whereas “her phone had a lot more percussion sound, indicating that area was previously hollow”He then took it under a microscope, without dismantling it. He looked through the cracks of the volume buttons and spotted a “red colored object placed in the volume down button crank.”Furthermore, he weighed and measured both devices and found out that while both devices are identical in size, the 128GB version is 21g heavier than the 16GB model.“I just don’t see the memory being that much heavier,” he said.No actual images or videos of any of these findings have been published, so it’s not clear whether doctorkuddles has actually discovered anything.Interestingly, he contacted the teardown experts at iFixit on the matter, who purchased a brand new 128GB iPhone 6 Plus and weighed it.“It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit,” iFixit’s mdjorie wrote on the same Reddit thread. “I don’t know what’s up with your new unit, OP, but our new unit definitely doesn’t weigh 21 grams more than the Day One device.”It’s not clear whether Apple made any internal design changes to its iPhones since the Bendgate issue was first reported, or whether it would be able to roll out changes so fast in case it did. But a previous report did reveal that Apple takes product launch-related issues and flaws very seriously and looks to fix problems as fast as possible following their discovery.",

The White House referred CNN to the Pentagon.”CNN added that the U.S. allegedly believes this based on “an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar.”Pentagon suspects detainee exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl attempting militant activity @barbarastarrcnn reports http://t.co/CWPGE3VWDF— Barbara Starr (@barbarastarrcnn) January 29, 2015The Associated Press provided a similar report, adding a named official to back up the assertion that the jihadists released for Bergdahl are now looking to return to terrorism.“Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.”Graham’s alleged assertions about the status of the five jihadists apparently is based on his visit to Qatar. The AP said that Graham “had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country,” although the Qatari government later assured him that all five jihadists remained in its borders, per the agreement with the U.S. government.This latest news involving the terrorists exchanged for Bergdahl comes at a time when the Obama administration is dealing with rumors regarding the ongoing investigation into his conduct leading up to his capture.The Inquisitr previously reported that some pundits and news outlets are claiming the government has decided to charge Bergdahl with desertion.However, the U.S. Department of Defense flatly denies such allegations. Meanwhile, this denial has caused more speculation on how the unofficial allegations and official denial of those allegations might be part of an ongoing fight behind the scenes.In fact, the Daily Signal argued the seemingly inconsistent “statements are not inconsistent.”“Shaffer and Miklaszewski report that Bergdahl will be charged—ostensibly soon. Kirby is merely saying Bergdahl has not been charged yet. And by saying Bergdahl has not had charges referred against him, he is betting the press and public don’t understand the unique procedural steps in the court-martial process.”The White House had not issued a statement on the latest reports regarding the alleged attempt of one or more of the jihadists released for Bergdahl to return to terrorism as of the time of the publication of this article.[Image via screen capture of Department of Defense video.]",

The city, known as ISIS’s most important strategic stronghold in Iraq, has been under the control of the Islamic State since June.Christy Feig, the World Health Organization (WHO) director of communications, told Mashable, “We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.” She said that WHO had reached out to authorities and asked if they needed help investigating the matter.Kurdish media network Xendan reported that ISIS jihadists’ symptoms were similar to those shown by someone who has contracted Ebola. However, it is highly uncertain whether Mosul health authorities have the means, tools, or skill-set necessary to test for Ebola, given the current hostile environment in the area.In late December, the Islamic State reportedly executed doctors who refused to treat their militant jihadis. The Washington Post said of the ongoing situation in Mosul, “Services are collapsing, prices are soaring, and medicines are scarce in towns and cities across the ‘caliphate’ proclaimed in Iraq and Syria by ISIS.”Iraq’s pro-government Al Sabaah (The Morning) daily newspaper reported that Ebola made its way into Mosul through Africa-based Islamist “terrorists” who then linked up with ISIS. Mashable notes, however, that the majority of ISIS recruits in Africa have come from countries that have not reported any Ebola cases, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, and others.Meanwhile, Mosul’s liberation remains a strategic priority for Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition. Mosul has been described as ISIS’s de facto capital in Iraq. While under ISIS control, many of the city’s one million residents have lived under fear of severe punishment or execution should they not comply with the jihadists’ mandates.",

Feminism is s good cause, but that is insane— Jacob Fitzgerald (@Igr8kcker) February 11, 2015Sex selection abortion is expected to be made officially illegal in the UK under an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, which has the backing of 70 MPs.The bill has completed its committee stage in the Commons and is intended to clarify the law on sex selective abortion.It also contains new measures to combat domestic violence and female genital mutilation (FGM).An alliance of faith and women's groups representing Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus has backed the amendment and said \"not enough is being done\" to stop the practice, the Daily Telegraph reported today.",

But that's not true - the true owner is a Swedish millionaire.\"If you have 45 million over and want to buy tiger woods house on an island in Lake Mälaren? Then it exactly right now you have the chance. \"Thus wrote radio station Mix Megapol programs last morning on Facebook on January 8, and linked to an object in the broker real estate agency. Anyone who clicked on the link found the island of Great Rullingen, a luxurious island dream equipped with everything from wine cellars to the ancient castle.At last morning's mail was shared over 300 times, and it was not just those who let themselves be impressed by the island. Even internationally the news that golf star Tiger Woods is now selling its Swedish island become widespread - it is published by the British The Telegraph and the Daily Mail , US New York Post o ch LA Times , and Yahoo .The only problem with the story is that Göteborgs-Posten drew attention already January 9, that the island is not at all belong to Tiger Woods. It says Johan Vesterberg on estate agency, who do not know how it is that the data started to circulate.- We have had this island for sale in a few months, and it started to pop up articles around the world that it was Tiger Woods who owned it. How it has started, we have no idea, says Vesterberg.In several articles written about the island quoted a Sabine Rollinger, an employee of the broker Vladi Private Islands. To The Telegraph, she says for example that Woods took the island, but that after his divorce with Swedish exhustrun Elin Nordegren \"did not need it anymore.\"But when Viral Inspector reaches Rollinger she writes in an email, \"to avoid misunderstanding\" that the island is not owned by Tiger Woods, but by a \"Swedish millionaire\".- He has commissioned us to sell it for him. As we understood it was designed originally for Tiger Woods and his wife. When their marriage suddenly ran out, he needed, however, it no longer writes Rollinger in an email.It rejects, however, Johan Vesterberg on estate agency.- It is not owned by Tiger Woods, and what we know, he has never owned it. The present owners have built it on the island now, and he did not for Tiger Woods, but for my part, he says.It's not the first time that Big roll no is up for sale. Already in 2011 attracted the attention of the media when it could be sold for 75 million. However, there was no one who bought the island at the time, and now the price has thus been reduced by 30 million.If you are conspiratorially inclined, of course, think it is very appropriate to task about Tiger Woods now gives the sales international attention. But that's not the broker real estate agency who planted the story, at least not according to Johan Vesterberg.- It is definitely not a negative to get noticed in this way. It is not no way we're working on, but we will not say no to the attention even if it is not true, he says.",

According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.\"Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson.

I am sure it is him.\"Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos: \"There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.\"'Counter-terrorism'Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.\"We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.\"From Britain to Syria via Kuwait, Tanzania and the NetherlandsEmwazi is understood to have arrived in Britain as a young boy, aged six, after being born in Kuwait. Growing up in west London, he was described as a \"polite, mild-mannered\" man with a penchant for wearing stylish clothes.It was during a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 that Emwazi's life direction is thought to have started to change. Once landing in Dar es Salaam on the supposed Safari trip with two friends, he alleged he was detained by gun-wielding Tanzanian police and held overnight.The trio were eventually refused entry to Tanzania and returned to the Netherlands, where they said they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.An article in The Independent in May 2010 outlines the allegations. Upon returning to the UK, Emwazi was reportedly on the radar of MI5, who warned him that he was on a terror watch list which prevented him travelling to any Muslim country.He is later understood to have filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his treatment.Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, it is understood he was detained once again by counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back.Two years later he was apparently in Syria fighting alongside IS.His first public appearance was last August in a video of the murder of American journalist James Foley in August, dressed in black with only his eyes visible. He later reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British charity worker Alan Henning.British and US security services have previously inferred that they knew his identity, but Thursday morning's developments and naming appear to have taken authorities by surprise.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: \"There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by so-called ISIL in Syria. We are not going to give a running commentary on any element of a live operational security investigation.\"",

Apple’s famous brand, loyal fan base, deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its Watch. However, Apple’s first-generation Watch is not yet perfect. For example, Apple’s Watch hardware design is arguably less attractive than some rival models such as the Huawei Watch, battery life may not be as long as many traditional wristwatch owners are used to, and Apple’s premium pricing may be challenging for mass-market consumers.

   "text": "The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a \"black hole\" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation.",

   "text": "WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”– Benjamin Fearnow",

(Photo courtesy: riyadhconnect.com)Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he wrote in his ruling. (Photo courtesy of Twitter)That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.“They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,” one Twitter user wrote.Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick. “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,” he wrote.A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: “A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,” the user wrote.

What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line \"Watch Edition\" will sell for.We've seen online reports that it could sell for as much as $4,000. Maybe more.So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch?Not much, as we recently found out in chats with consumers here.\"I'd get the $350 model,\" says Ashlea Fellows of Australia. \"I wouldn't go any higher.\"Thousands of dollars for a gold watch? Not for Karla Gallegos of Chile. \"Too expensive. I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,\" she said.Juan Frias of New York would drop $1,000. \"I like gold watches,\" he says. \"I'm a teacher, and I wouldn't have to look down at my wrist. My daughter texts me, I can look and nobody can say, `Hey, you're on the phone.'\"Apple touts the high-end Apple Watch as sporting a 18-karat gold case, which it says is twice as hard as standard gold. And it's protected by sapphire crystal, advertised as almost impossible to break, unlike the gorilla glass of the iPhone.In mid-2014, many analysts expected Apple to use sapphire glass on the iPhone 6, but that didn't happen. Apple wasn't happy with the sapphire being produced by its factory near Phoenix, which has since been shut down. The company hasn't said where its new sapphire is being produced.Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Website Grail-watch.com goes as high as $10,000. \"t's pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size,\" notes the site.But even at $4,000 or $5,000, the price tag will make it easily the most expensive item at the Apple Store. It's most expensive computer, the MacPro, starts at around $3,000.Apple's high-priced watch will be in good company -- and even if it tops the most optimistic estimates, it will be still be way cheaper than the gold standard of luxury watches, the Rolex. Amazon's Rolex page starts at $4,000 and goes all the way up to $62,000.But those watches don't read back texts or control your music.With such expensive i-jewelry on display at shopping malls across the world, will it change the way people shop at the Apple Store? Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists?Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. \"It would….but you've got to go Gold,\" he said. \"If you've got it, flaunt it.\"Follow Jefferson Graham on Twitter",

The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.“If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.”She wrote that during her experiences of fighting for women’s rights, she found that “men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances”.“This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it,” she wrote.Lana’s blog post has since received much criticism, with people calling her a “mentally ill female”, and writing messages such as: “Her mother already brought a monster into the word by giving birth to HER!”On her blog Lana wrote that she had lost many friends and family members over the last three years, and responded to the criticism she had received.“I cannot believe some of the emails that have been forwarded to me, do people really exist who want to see me dead because of what I chose to do with my own body?,” she wrote.“The thing that I hope everyone takes away from all of this is that I own the reasons why I chose to have an abortion. Most of you reading probably have no idea what it is like to go through the process of debating whether or not to abort a pregnancy, let alone the actual experience of it.“To me, the experience was liberating, the emotions I felt when deciding what I should do, and after learning my foetus was male was something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Coming out of it a liberated woman though was more than worth it.”Abortion based on gender is already illegal here in the UK, but MPs have been fighting to clarify the amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act that states this.The amendment reads: \"Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.\"A Telegraph investigation found that gender-based abortion does still take place in the UK, with some cultures favouring boys over girls.",

When Conal tried to cancel his subscription in October 2013, Comcast reportedly sent him $1,820 worth of equipment he didn't request — stuff like modems, DVRs, etc. — and charged him for it. When Conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the Comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges, they refused to acknowledge the mistake.So Conal decided to escalate the issue to the company's controller, but when he spoke to someone in the office there, she was equally unhelpful. No one ever sorted out Conal's customer-service request.This, Conal claims, is where it gets messy. The accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from Comcast contacted his employer to say Conal had called to express his displeasure with Comcast. The call kicked off an ethics investigation that led to Conal's firing.According to the Consumerist:Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.Plus, though his company consulted with Comcast, Conal argues that bringing their name up wouldn't have helped his situation in the first place.Comcast: still the worst.",

Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale has dropped out of the project.Sources told THR that “after much deliberation and conflicting feelings” Bale “came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw.” Before Bale was given the chance to turn down the role, it was reportedly offered to Leonardo DiCaprio, who also declined.Meanwhile, it was reported last week that Seth Rogen is set to play Jobs’ co-founder Steve Wozniak. But without a signed deal with producer Scott Rudin, that casting could definitely change as well.With Bale and DiCaprio out of the picture, what appropriately-aged, Oscar-calibar actor who looks enough like Steve Jobs could be left?

   "text": "Questions surrounded purported deal between Nigerian government and Boko Haram for release of missing schoolgirlsThe Nigerian government says it has agreed a ceasefire with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram and is negotiating for the release of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped six months ago.The deal would mark a huge breakthrough after a five-year insurgency by extremists seeking to create an Islamic state in the north of Africa’s most populous country. It has left thousands dead and a worldwide outcry was prompted when the girls were abducted in April from the north-eastern town of Chibok.Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign tweeted: “We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.”But questions surrounded the purported agreement on Friday. Similar claims from the government and military have failed to bear fruit. The Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to declare that he is standing for re-election, and positive news about the hostages and insurgency could deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis.Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital, Abuja: “Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.”Omeri claimed that there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the missing girls. Boko Haram negotiators “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”, he said.The truce was announced on Friday by Nigeria’s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who ordered his troops to comply immediately with the agreement. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.The group had been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan had said he could not countenance a prisoner swap.The failure of Jonathan’s government to rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily Bring Back Our Girls rallies in Abuja to highlight the girls’ plight. There was further anger when posters calling for Jonathan’s re-election in February by using the hashtag BringBackGoodluck2015 appeared until he ordered them to be torn down.In July, Jonathan met for the first time parents of the girls and dozens of classmates who managed to escape. It followed months of controversy in which the parents had sought a meeting. He finally agreed to the meeting after a request from Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by Taliban militants in 2012 and won the Nobel peace prize this month for her campaigning for girls’ right to an education.Jonathan’s principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as a deal to release the 219 girls.Tukur said he had represented the government at two meetings with the Islamist extremists in neighbouring Chad, mediated by that country’s president, Idriss Déby. “Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,” said Tukur. “They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” he added.But there was uncertainty about the identity of Boko Haram’s representative at the talks, named by Tukur as Danladi Ahmadu.Multiple analysts cast doubt on Ahmadu’s credibility as a Boko Haram envoy. Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP: “I have never heard of such a man, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire, it would come from the group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau.”Ralph Bello-Fadile, an assistant to Nigeria’s national security adviser (NSA), told a conference on Monday that it had been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. “Government wants to negotiate, but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau,” he told a Chatham House event in Abuja.Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday yesterday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group’s chief security officer and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means “western education is forbidden”. The name was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders – the insurgents themselves never use the term. Their leaders have exclusively used the name Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, which means “People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet’s Teachings and Jihad”.Boko Haram stormed the school in Chibok in April and snatched nearly 300 students, of whom 219 remain in captivity. This week about 50 protesters in red shirts tried to march to the presidential villa but were repeatedly diverted by riot police. The president has blamed activists for politicising the abductions and influencing the parents.",

The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”James Foley in Aleppo, Syria, in November 2012.Image: Nicole TungThe video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, \"A message to America,\" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.\"I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,\" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.\"This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,\" the man says in British-accented English. \"As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.\"The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.\"The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.\"Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.The video then goes black.The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, \"anti-democracy.

And I know how crazy this sounds, but we need an #ISISmediaBlackout. Amputate their reach. Pour water on their flame,\" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. \"From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,\" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: \"We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers.

Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.David Fincher had originally been announced as the film’s director, but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film. Bale had been Fincher’s first choice to play Jobs.Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015. Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs “is a little like writing about the Beatles.

   "text": "Fourteen more police arrested as forensic investigators find no trace of students missing since violent confrontation in GuerreroAuthorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico say they are yet to find any trace of 43 students who disappeared after a confrontation with police.None was among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the 26 September attack, said the attorney general, Jesús Murillo Karam.Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of a 10th mass grave on Tuesday. An additional 14 police officers had been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighbouring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in taking the students. The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.Karam said officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack but the collusion might have gone beyond just one town. “There’s a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it’s clear to me that they were working together,” he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.Police opened fire on about 100 teaching college students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in IgualaSix people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, despite investigators combing the clandestine burial sites outside Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.On Tuesday, the Guerrero governor, Angel Aguirre, said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.“Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,” Aguirre told MVS radio.One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification was an arduous, time-consuming process. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves could leave very little DNA for testing.Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched peacefully to the centre of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.They lined up in silence as organisers handed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1m peso (£47,000) reward for information.On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles south of Mexico City, and set fire to buildings.",

   "text": "Throughout the three-plus years of the Syrian civil war, one oft-sung refrain among some American officials has been that arming Syrian moderates (whoever they may be) is a dicey proposition because the weapons \"could fall into the wrong hands.\"Despite these objections, the United States eventually sent military aid to the Free Syrian Army last year. The policy change was precipitated by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's violation of the Obama administration's \"red line\" after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians.Last month, with the rise of ISIS in mind, Congress approved the president's plan to to train and arm the Syrian rebels. There was some familiar dissent at the time. \"How will we ensure that the United States weapons we are providing to Syrian rebels will not get into the wrong hands, as they did with the rebels we supported in Libya?\" Representative Barbara Lee asked.On the same day as that vote, Islamic State fighters first encircled Kobani, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, attacking the largely Kurdish town and inspiring vigorous American airstrikes. On Monday, hoping to decisively turn the tide in the battle, the United States airdropped weapons to the Syrian Kurds of Kobani. By way of explanation, especially to a skeptical Turkish audience, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry offered that not aiding the Kurds in their fight against ISIS is both \"irresponsible\" and \"morally very difficult.\"Unfortunately, with that one airdrop, the weight of the American dread about where its weapons might go also landed. According to the Associated Press, some of the weapons meant to reach the Kurds ended up in Islamic State hands instead.The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State.The Associated Press said the video was consistent with other reporting. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, British activist group, added that more than one cache of weapons might have been snatched up by Islamic State fighters.Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that Islamic State fighters have captured American weapons.

   "text": "The state of North Dakota has named a new publicly-owned landfill after President Barack Obama.In an overwhelming 35-10 vote, the state Senate advanced a bill naming a 650-acre site currently under construction after the nation’s 44th president. Governor Jack Dalrymple is expected to sign the measure into law Tuesday.When completed, the Barack Obama Memorial Landfill will be the largest waste disposal site in North Dakota, and the 17th largest in the United States. It will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries.“We wanted to do something to honor the president,” says Republican State Senator Doug Perlman, who was the lead sponsor of the bill. “And I think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to Obama’s presidency.“We originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain. But then someone jokingly suggested we name it after Obama. I never thought and idea like that would actually pass. But I was pleasantly surprised.”The president is hardly popular in North Dakota. The most recent poll in December 2013 found that Obama has a 35% approval rating in the state, although that figure may have fallen further in the year since. Yet even considering the political climate, seasoned observers are surprised that two Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill’s passage.“I supported Obama because I thought he would end the wars in the Middle East;” says Allison Mitchell, a progressive Democrat from Grand Forks. “But he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home.“I guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because I’m a Democrat. But honestly I don’t really care anymore. Maybe this small act of protest will wake him up.”Ordinary citizens in the state also seem to approve of the government’s choice.“I can’t think of a better name,” says Joe Blough, a plumber from Minot. “It’s darkly colored and it's full of shit. That pretty much sums up Obama.”",

   "text": "Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured.Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page.The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story \"mere propaganda\". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible.Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting.Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north.Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet. A link will be added in the comments if the story is officially confirmed or denied.Pictures of Rosenberg (Not a repost! The article is completely original content.

   "text": "When you complain to your cable company, you certainly don’t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But that’s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH…Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal’s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal’s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.CUTTING THE CORDHe attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.But things didn’t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn’t order.“There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,” he says.Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he’d never requested and had no use for.When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation’s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.He says even this didn’t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn’t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal’s account into collections in Feb. 2014.THE CALL IN QUESTIONAnd so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast’s customer service, which hadn’t been of any help in the year he’d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company’s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.He describes that callback as “bizarre,” with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with “How can I help you?” Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn’t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.So he tried the Controller’s office again, to let them know that the rep they’d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.But something did happen. Just not anything good.WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORKRemember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it’s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast’s books. So Conal doesn’t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.In response to a letter from Conal’s lawyer — he has not filed a lawsuit, but it’s not out of the question — Comcast’s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal’s employer but says that Conal “is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn” about his dispute with Comcast.THE HEART OF THE MATTERI think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office.Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.I’m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like “I’m a lawyer” or “I’m a big shot at [fill in the blank]“? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer’s employer?We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it’s company policy to contact customers’ employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.“Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,” reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds “we will review his lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”",

It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,” Dylan said.The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days.",

The White House said they have not yet confirmed the authenticity of the video. The video starts with a clip of President Barack Obama earlier this month making the announcement that he had authorized targeted strikes in Iraq to protect American interests in Irbil. It then cuts to a title scene that says \"Message to America\" before cutting to a desert scene, with Foley in orange clothes on his knees, and a man in all black standing next to him. In the video Foley delivers a statement calling on his friends and family to \"rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government.\"Then the ISIS member makes a statement. Speaking in what may possibly be a British accent, he identifies Foley and says his death is a direct result of American intervention in Iraq. \"So any attempt by you Obama, to deny the Muslims of living in safety under Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.\"He then beheads Foley.Freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff is then shown also in an orange jumpsuit on his knees. The man in black then says \"The life of this American citizen Obama, depends on your next decision.\"About 20 minutes after posting the video was removed from YouTube.According to BuzzFeed, two people who know Foley confirmed that the man in the video looks and sounds like him.In a statement, National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said that if the video is genuine they are \"appalled by the brutal murder.\" \"We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”Foley, 40, grew up in New Hampshire and was originally a teacher, at one point teaching prison inmates in Arizona, before attending the Medill school of journalism at Northwestern University. After graduation, his first assignment was as an embed with the U.S. Army’s 173rd Brigade and 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan.  Foley had been covering the Syria's civil war for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse (AFP) when he was allegedly pulled from the car he was traveling in to meet with a colleague and abducted at gunpoint. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, GlobalPost hired an international security firm for a ground level investigation in Northern Syria and along the Turkish border to locate him.Foley was also detained and held for 44 days in Libya in 2011.

   "text": "A baseball cap and a portrait of Michael Brown is shown alongside his casket inside Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church before the start of funeral services in St. Louis, Missouri. Photo: ReutersFerguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.\"This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,\" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.\"The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,\" she said of Mr Wilson.The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.MCT, Reuters",

   "text": "Just moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.Scroll down for videosJob done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morningIn control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a heroDespite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.Back to work: Heroic Kevin Vickers was pictured at work on Thursday just hours after he shot dead Zehaf-Bibeau and stopped the terrorist in his tracksCanadian hero: Vickers, 58, is pictured in a file photo wearing his ceremonial garb and carrying a scepter. As sergeant-at-arms, it his job to uphold the security of the House of CommonsRiveting video: Vickers led the way as officials chased down terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday after he murdered reservist Nathan Cirillo and entered the House of Commons buildingInches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus roomsAnd like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'Heroic: He took down Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, pictured - his first ever exchange of gunfire in his careerInnocent victim: Natan Cirillo, 24, was the soldier shot dead in Wednesday's terror attack on the Canadian Parliament complex'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday when he returned to the more usual duty of delivering the ceremonial mace to the chamberVickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanksHe released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg.'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.Immigration chief Susan Bibeau - mother of terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time.'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'Tribute: Stephen Harper laid a floral tribute at the scene of the shooting alongside his wife Loreen on Thursday morningArrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across OttawaChilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking.The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.He added: 'It was pretty intense.'",

   "text": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese authorities detained a woman and young boy believed to be the wife and son of the reclusive Islamic State group leader, and were questioning the woman and conducting DNA tests on the child, senior Lebanese officials said Tuesday.If their identities are confirmed, Lebanon may use the pair as bargaining chips to win the release of soldiers and police taken hostage by the extremists in cross-border attacks earlier this year.The woman, who was identified as an Iraqi, and the child were taken into custody about 10 days ago while carrying fake ID cards, the officials said.Very little is known about Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's personal life, including how many wives and children he has. Conservative interpretations of Islam allow men to marry up to four wives. The Islamic State group did not immediately comment on the detentions, but the faction's supporters on Twitter and militant websites cast doubt on the reports.Adding to the confusion, the Lebanese army did not release an official statement regarding the pair.A Lebanese military official identified the woman as Saja al-Dulaimi who was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida-linked branch, earlier this year. The official said the woman \"confessed during interrogation\" that she was al-Baghdadi's wife.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.In March, the Nusra Front freed more than a dozen Greek Orthodox nuns in exchange for the release of dozens of female prisoners by the Syrian government. A woman named Saja al-Dulaimi was reportedly on the list of prisoners freed by Damascus.A judicial official said the interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor, Saqr Saqr, and that a DNA test was underway to confirm that the child is her son. Experts said it would be difficult to confirm whether the woman is indeed al-Baghdadi's wife.It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small — although growing — support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.The detentions added to the mystery that continues to surround al-Baghdadi, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. He has only made one known public appearance — a sermon he delivered in July at a mosque in Mosul just days after IS declared him the head of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territory the group controls in Syria and Iraq.Last month, Iraqi officials claimed he was wounded in an airstrike. The U.S. has not confirmed those reports, and al-Baghdadi released a new audiotape days after he was purportedly hit.The Lebanese daily As-Safir first reported the detention of the Islamic State leader's alleged relatives, saying the woman and boy were taken into custody near a border crossing point with Syria. It said the arrest came in \"coordination with foreign intelligence agencies.\"If the pair's identities are confirmed, the detentions could give Lebanese authorities leverage in their attempts to reach a prisoner-exchange deal with militants from the Islamic State group and the Nusra Front. The extremists have been holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and policemen hostage since August, and have demanded the release of Islamist prisoners held by Lebanon. On Monday night, the Nusra Front threatened to kill one of the soldiers it holds captive.Lebanese troops have clashed repeatedly with militants along the border with Syria since August.On Tuesday, militants ambushed a Lebanese army patrol near the frontier, killing six soldiers and wounding one, Lebanon's military said. The attack occurred in a remote region of Ras Baalbek in eastern Lebanon and was followed by clashes, the army said in a statement.It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but there was no immediate indication that it was connected to the detention of al-Baghdadi's alleged family members.Meanwhile, supporters of the Islamic State group released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.The video, posted online Monday by the Al-Battar Media Foundation, shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man inside, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video's authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving Nov. 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by Islamic State supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.The video also includes audio clips of Islamic State group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters Tuesday that \"the Dane is doing better.\"Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.____Associated Press writers Zeina Karam in Beirut, Maamoun Youssef in Cairo and Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",

Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night's Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award.After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People's Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the 'West boycott.'While it is true that West created a stir at the 2015 Grammy Awards when he briefly interrupted Beck during the musician's acceptance speech (just as he had done to Taylor Swift in 2009), Kanye has not been banned from all future award shows.The Adobo Chronicles is another \"satire\" publication that publishes fake news.

   "text": "(This article originally appeared on tech.qq.com on 03/02/2015. For original Chinese, click here.)The App Store's 'Top Apps' lists are well known to the smartphone-savvy public, but how apps make it into those lists is perhaps less understood. Today, one micro-blog shared photos under the heading \"It's Hard Being a Top App Worker,\" publicly exposing the operations behind App Store rank-boosting (Ed: which I henceforth dub 'crank-boosting') labour. The exposé, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. Apple has previously adopted measures to deter crank-boosting in order to ensure fair rankings for developers and users. In 2014 November, Apple introduced a 1 yuan strategy to drop the threshold for users to download apps, also intended to negatively impact the crank-boosting industry. But as crank-boosting simulates genuine user activity, it is nearly impossible to detect or safeguard against. Users accustomed to comparing and contrasting apps before download may be unknowingly swayed by crank-boosted apps that have purchased their celebrity. Such sneaky, industrious operations are tricky to break.",

Witnesses in Iguala say municipal police officers whisked several of the students away.Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, declined to say how many bodies were buried in the pits.\"We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies.

Authorities are conducting DNA analysis to identify the victims.The graves were found after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location, Blanco said. The detainees include 22 police officers and gang members.If the bodies are confirmed to be those of the students, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date.View galleryPolicemen stand guard at Pueblo Viejo, in the outskirts&nbsp;&hellip;Policemen stand guard at Pueblo Viejo, in the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state, Mexico, where a m …- Police linked to gang -The students from a teacher training college disappeared last weekend after Iguala police officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return home after holding fundraising activities on September 26.

The AP and others reported that the two of them \"were carrying fake identification cards\" when they were picked up near the Syrian border about 10 days ago. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir noted that the operation was conducted with the involvement of “foreign intelligence.” As Reuters reported, Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, \"two Iraqis and one Syrian.\"By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.According to a security source quoted in AFP, \"the wife and child were taken to the defense ministry headquarters in Yarze, just outside the capital Beirut, 'where investigations were continuing.'\" The source added that the arrests had been kept under wraps so that security arrangements could be made.It's unclear how useful these arrests will ultimately be, but they come as Lebanese authorities attempt to secure the release of 20 soldiers who are currently being held captive by Islamist groups. By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.This is already proving to be a bad week for ISIS. While the United States and Turkey had been rumored to be close to a deal to coordinate efforts against the Islamic State, on Tuesday, the Iraqi government reached a once-elusive agreement with the Kurds on both oil sharing and military cooperation in the campaign to fight ISIS.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who took over for the divisive Nuri al-Maliki, is receiving plaudits for his role in bringing the Kurds back into the fold and at least temporarily staving off a Kurdish push for independence.",

The source said that he had noticed a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward and said that bodyguards had been added as extra security.Kim has not been seen in public since September 3, and his absence has prompted rampant speculation about his health. The whispers grew louder when he failed to attend a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly last week. The rumors reached a fever pitch Thursday when North Korea's state-run television station showed the man it calls the \"Great Successor\" limping and admitted that he was feeling unwell, an extraordinary move for the tightly-controlled propaganda unit.A South Korean intelligence official told the Chosun Ilbo that Kim had initially sprained his ankle over the summer during a tour of military bases and factories and aggravated the injury by not undergoing treatment immediately. Kim has noticeably gained weight since succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il in 2011 and is rumored to be suffering from various ailments, including gout, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.However, the South Korean intelligence official said that an attack of gout would not have been enough to keep him from the Supreme People's Assembly session, lending further credence to the surgery theory. The Chosun Ilbo had reported Monday that a team of doctors from France, Germany, and Russia had recently gone to North Korea.Click for more from the Chosun Ilbo.",

   "text": "American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley. A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner. U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said. The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as \"The Beatles.\"The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain's two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.A counterterrorism source told Fox News that the investigation was moving forward and slowly eliminating individuals of interest. The source also told Fox News that the FBI had opened a crisis file shortly after Foley was kidnapped in northern Syria in November 2012 that included signals intelligence and interviews with former hostages. The Sunday Mirror, citing British intelligence sources, identified two other suspects as 20-year-old Abu Hussain al-Britani, originally from Birmingham, and 23-year-old Abu Abduallah al-Britani (no known relation), originally from the county of Hampshire on England's south coast. The Mail on Sunday reported that the three men known as \"John,\" \"George,\" and \"Ringo\" had formed a special kidnapping gang that may have targeted Westerners like Foley. The paper reported that the hostages regarded the group as particularly vicious jailers, who routinely beat their prisoners and tortured them with Tasers. At one point, the paper reported, the \"Beatles\" were actually prohibited from guarding the hostages due to the level of violence they inflicted.According to The Mail on Sunday, the \"Beatles\" also boasted that they had made millions of dollars from ransoms paid by European countries, enough to \"retire to Kuwait or Qatar,\" as one hostage told the paper. The U.S. and Britain have a policy of not paying ransom to terrorist groups in exchange for captured citizens. However, other Western countries have no such policy. The New York Times reported last month that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have received at least $125 million in ransom money since 2008, paid by European countries like France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. Similarly, The Mail on Sunday reported that France had paid approximately $13.2 million for the release of four hostages held by ISIS earlier this year, while Italy had paid close to $5 million for the release of an Italian journalist. The release of seven other European journalists and aid workers reportedly cost a combined $26.5 million. Last week, the CEO of GlobalPost, a media organization where Foley had worked, revealed that ISIS had demanded a ransom of $132 million in exchange for Foley's release. In addition to Foley, ISIS is believed to be holding three other Americans hostage. One of them, journalist Steven Sotloff, is threatened with beheading by the militant known as \"John\" at the end of the video released last week. Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.",

   "text": "This photo of a note to parents, purportedly printed on a pamphlet included in a LEGO set from the 1970s, has been making laps around the Internet. The legitimacy of the note, which is noteworthy for its egalitarian tone, has been called into question – but there's good reason to believe it's real.A photo of the note was posted to imgur yesterday by redditor fryd_, where it's received a lot of attention. It's also gained purchase on Twitter. As of this posting, this tweet by @henrywarren has been retweeted over three-thousand times:Pretty great, right? We think so, too. So do a lot of other people. But the legitimacy of the note has been called into question. \"Not because the message is bad, but I'd be skeptical about the authenticity of this,\" reads one of the top comments from the original post. On Twitter, others have flagged the note's typesetting and LEGO logo as anachronistic. At Boing Boing, Rob Beschizza wonders aloud how likely it is \"that Lego would have used a proportional Times-esque typeface—with such sloppy layout—in the early 1970s.\"There's also the lack of evidence from the original photographer, who writes:I had no idea this would blow up so much, so didn't take more photos but this was at my partner's Grandma's house, on the back page of a pamphlet that came with a set from 73 she still has. There was a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house. Sorry I don't have more info...So – is it a fake? Probably not! For one thing, the logo in the note is the one you would expect to find in a LEGO pamphlet from the seventies, and is subtly but noticeably different from the more modern LEGO logo, which was updated in 1998:",

   "text": "News of guitarist Willie Nelson’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the February 2015 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, the guitarist best known for hit songs like To All the Girls I've Loved Before or Pancho and Lefty is alive and well.UPDATE 24/02/2015 : This story seems to be false. (read more)Willie Nelson death hoax spreads on FacebookRumors of the guitarist’s alleged demise gained traction on Sunday after a ‘R.I.P. Willie Nelson’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American guitarist’s passing:“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (February 22, 2015), our beloved guitarist Willie Nelson passed away. Willie Nelson was born on April 30, 1933 in Abbott. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 81-year-old guitarist and singer was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a guitarist of Willie Nelson's stature would be major news across networks.A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (90%) of respondents think those Willie Nelson death rumors are not funny anymore.Willie Nelson Death Hoax Dismissed Since Guitarist Is ‘Alive And Well’On Monday (February 23) the guitarist's reps officially confirmed that Willie Nelson is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved guitarist. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.© 2015 MediaMass All rights reserved. Do not reproduce (even with permission).",

   "text": "Have you ever had your picture taken at an… unfortunate moment? Or worse yet, been caught on video when it really looked like you were doing something you weren’t? It doesn’t entirely matter what the confusion is, so much as people’s willingness to assume the worst, which is precisely what happened to a veteran meteorologist on national television over the weekend. But now, anchor Brian Williams has leapt in to save the day — he explained that NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel wasn’t peeing in the snow while on-air with Lester Holt, despite how it may have looked, and he called for an apology for the confusion.Seidel is no stranger to inclement and chaotic weather, as he’s been reporting out of extreme conditions for years. In this case, he was in the thick of a storm in North Carolina when, according to Williams, he lost his cell phone connection to the NBC studio, and thus didn’t realize he was live on-camera. And while he took off his gloves and fiddled with his phone to call them back, turned away from the camera, it painted a very particular picture — basically, it kinda looked like he was pissing in the snow, and that was all it took for social media to explode.Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night. … that’s when the rumors hit that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow.Of course, Williams is well-known to be a good sport with a decent sense of humor, so one hopes his request for an apology for Seidel isn’t too stern. Though really, it wouldn’t much help if it was — he’s calling for “social media” to apologize, after all, so good luck with that. Nor would it have been a big deal if he actually had been, ahem, “writing his name in the snow.” Because believe it or not, everybody has to go now and then, even the people on the TV. They’re just like us!Notwithstanding however, Williams, NBC (and Seidel himself, one assumes) wanted to clear the air about this humble mix-up, and that’s all well and good. Unfortunately, it does steal away basically all the replay value of that misunderstood footage, though. If I wanted to watch somebody struggle to make a phone call with their back to me, I’d… well, I wouldn’t! Because I don’t want to see that, I just want to see weather reporters sneakily peeing in snow drifts. Is that so much to ask?Images: NBC Nightly News/YouTube; Mike Seidel/YouTube",

Announcing the return of the girls, whose abduction inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, could help Jonathan’s electoral aspirations — even if the claim turns out not to be entirely true.The Nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past. The government even once claimed to have rescued the girls.In particular, experts questioned the credibility of Danladi Ahmadu, who the government said was Boko Haram’s representative in the talks.“I have never heard of Ahmadu, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group’s leader Abubakar Shekau,” Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP.The Nigerian military has been fighting Boko Haram since 2009. Multiple attempts at reaching a cease-fire have proven unsuccessful.",

We’re calling shenanigans, because superheroes never want their true identities revealed.So, update — wink wink, nudge nudge — the man in the video is definitely not Paul Rudd. Either that, or we have a much bigger clone problem on our hands than we initially assumed.—EARLIER: Look, we’ve always suspected that Paul Rudd was a super nice guy. While we would normally be suspicious of someone who doesn’t age (seriously, take a look at “Clueless” and then remember that was 19 years ago), his adorable stories about teenage kegger antics, being too ripped for his “Ant-Man” costume and punnily helping people announce their impending offspring help keep those suspicions at bay.And now a new video, coupled with a little bit of investigative Twitter journalism (twournalism), really drives the point home, hard. Recently a unnamed man went on a homophobic rant at the Dallas airport, eventually trying to get violent with the man he was yelling at. As he lashed out, a group of passers by tackled him and pinned him to the ground, restraining him until police could come and handcuff him. And guess what! One of those randos was none other than Paul Rudd.Yep, keep an eye out for him in a blue checked shirt and olive-colored jacket, jumping on and holding the dude down. Wonkette has the backstory of how we figured out it was Ant-Man himself.Just add this incident to the growing list of reasons we suspect Rudd is an actual superhero.",

According to the Globe and Mail, he had been designated a \"high-risk traveler\" by Canadian officials and was barred from traveling outside the country.After police chased him inside the Parliament building, Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sgt. at Arms Kevin Vickers.Witnesses told the AP that Zehaf-Bibeau was wearing a scarf over his face when he opened fire in front of the Canadian War Memorial, which is across the street from Parliament.The Canadian Broadcast Company released an image purported to be of the gunman:BREAKING | This is a photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning's shootings in Ottawa. #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/OLSxlYPelj— CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 22, 2014An Ottawa police spokesman told HuffPost that the police were looking for at least one other suspect. However, in a press conference later on Wednesday, officials declined to say if there were multiple possible shooters.Wednesday's shooting quickly sparked terrorism fears. Just two days earlier, a Quebec man suspected of ties to radical Islam killed one soldier and wounded another with his car before being killed by police. As Reuters pointed out, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the attacker, was one of 90 people being monitored by Canadian national police over extremist beliefs.Earlier this month, NBC News reported that the Canadian government was monitoring \"hundreds of people\" that it suspected could be planning to join ISIS.

Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa.As of the end of 2014, the total death count from the largest Ebola outbreak in history stands at 7,890 people, while over 20,000 have been diagnosed with the disease, for which there is no cure.The West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus.ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.Confirmation of Ebola cases will likely be difficult, however, as U.N. workers are prohibited from entering militant-controlled areas.The militants have become known for executing prisoners, including women and children, and giving Christians and other religious minorities an option to convert to Islam, pay a tax or be killed. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters.The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak.Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed.It is also not know how many fighters from West African countries could have joined ISIS, though tens of thousands of foreigners and several other jihadist groups have reportedly rallied under the Islamic State banner.Nigerian terror group Boko Haram also pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014 — Nigeria experienced its own scare with Ebola after a number of cases of the virus were reported, but the country was declared Ebola-free by October.",

The unidentified woman invited him to accompany her to a sauna where, according to police reports, they drank beer and kissed before he blacked out. The next morning, Dimitry woke up at a bus stop to find that his phone, wallet, and testicles had all been stolen. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors informed him that the procedure must have been done by someone with medical knowledge, as the surgery was done skillfully and his sack was carefully sewn up again following the removal of his nuts. Police therefore believe this was probably a result of organ trafficking, as opposed to a vindictive crime. Russian newspaper Life News reports that the actor is having trouble figuring out how to explain the situation to his wife, and for now is simply telling her he is at the hospital for a \"serious illness.\" Though given that the story is all over the media, it's likely she's learned the truth by now.",

   "text": "The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria posted a video on Tuesday that it said showed the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist who was kidnapped in Syria nearly two years ago, according to a transcript released by the SITE Intelligence Group.The authenticity of the video, which was also posted on YouTube, could not be verified, and a telephone call placed to Mr. Foley’s family was not immediately returned. YouTube later took down the four-minute, 40-second video.Continue reading the main storyRELATED COVERAGEMEMENTOS FROM CAPTIVITY: Items saved by Harald Ickler, a Swede living in Germany, from his 54 days as a hostage in 2003. He was on what he thought would be a four-week adventure vacation when he was kidnapped in the Algerian desert by jihadists who would soon become an official arm of Al Qaeda.Underwriting Jihad: Paying Ransoms, Europe Bankrolls Qaeda TerrorJULY 29, 2014The Lede: Investigation Suggests American Journalist Missing in Syria Is ‘Likely’ Held by GovernmentMAY 3, 2013Titled “A Message to America,” the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit — an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers — the U.S. government — for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, “they signed my death certificate.”On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son’s disappearance: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley’s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag “#NewMessageFromISIStoUS” surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the fighter says.Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha’s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,” she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley’s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. “We are still evaluating the video at this time,” he said.Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s crumbling government.He was among dozens of journalists — many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization — who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.Correction: August 19, 2014 An earlier version of a summary with this article misstated the location of the airstrikes that ISIS opposed.

Sources say that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary left his family’s upscale home in London last year to join ISIS.Bary is believed to have traveled to Syria, and recently tweeted a picture of himself holding a severed head.Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary had a somewhat successful rap career, with some of his songs earning play on BBC radio. In early songs he made references to drug use and violence, as well as the threat of his family being deported to Egypt. His father, Adel Abdul Bary, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 and was believed to be a close lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.“It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there’s funds in the bank.“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain’t got normal feelings.“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”In the James Foley beheading video, a masked executioner with a British accent read a statement warning the United States not to enter the conflict. The man later severed Foley’s neck with a knife and cut off is head.Experts believe that British forces had likely identified Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary not long after the video was released.Professor Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said authorities were likely quite familiar with the British suspect.He said: “I’d be very surprised if they haven’t already narrowed it down to a small group of people.“The video provides enough clues to show who is responsible. MI6 probably do have a rough idea already of where the hostages are. The intelligence agencies probably have it narrowed down to two or three people.”British intelligence has not officially confirmed that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect in the James Foley beheading.",

   "text": "UK Prime Minister David Cameron denounced the Islamic State (IS) jihadist organisation as “monsters” Sunday after the Foreign Office said a video showing the murder of a British aid worker appeared to be authentic.\"All the signs are that the video is genuine, we have no reason to believe that it's not,\" a spokesman for the Foreign Office told AFP.The video showing the beheading of David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, was released by IS militants late Saturday. It was the third beheading of a Western hostage by the group in less than a month.After chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee Sunday, Cameron condemned IS, which has conquered vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, as the \"embodiment of evil\" and vowed that the UK would do everything possible to find Haines’s killers.\"We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes,\" the grim-faced premier said in a televised statement from Downing Street.He continued: \"Step by step we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (IS) and what is stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination.\"We will not do so on our own, but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but with our allies in the region.\"US President Barack Obama said after the killing that the United States would stand with Britain in an expanded effort against the terror group.“We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,” he said.No comment on air strikesHaines, 44, had been taken hostage in Syria in March 2013 while working for the French NGO ACTED, which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and rebel groups, including IS, seeking to oust him.Cameron described 44-year-old Haines as a \"British hero\", saying that \"his selflessness, his decency, his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life\".Those who killed him \"are not Muslims, they are monsters\", he said.Cameron repeated his support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq, and for President Obama's strategy to build a broad coalition to fight the jihadists.But despite growing calls at home for action against IS, Cameron made no commitment to Britain joining the air strikes.London began sending arms this week to Kurdish fighters battling IS militants in northern Iraq, but it has faced accusations of confusion over its strategy.During a visit to Berlin this week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain would not take part in strikes against IS in Syria, after parliament last year voted against taking military action in that country.But just hours later, a spokesman for Cameron's Downing Street office insisted the prime minister was not ruling anything out.In the footage of Haines’s murder, a hooded militant blames Cameron for joining forces with the United States and says the alliance will drag the British people into \"another bloody and unwinnable war\".‘Barbaric crime must not remain unpunished’In a statement, ACTED said it was “deeply appalled and horrified” by the murder.“David was a new member of the ACTED team supporting the emergency humanitarian response for the displaced Syrian people in Atmeh camp near to the Turkish border,” it said.“David was appreciated by the ACTED team and all those around him, notably for his generosity, commitment, and his professionalism.“The horrible assassination of David, an aid worker, goes against all humanitarian principles and is a crime against humanity. This barbaric crime must not remain unpunished.”Before joining ACTED, Haines had also worked for groups such as Handicap International, which helps the disabled during conflicts, and Nonviolent Peaceforce, which sends unarmed peacekeepers into conflict zones. He had previously been in Libya during its civil war and South Sudan.His brother, Mike Haines, said he had also worked for the United Nations in the Balkans “helping people in real need”.“His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,” Mike Haines said. “He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.”(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP)Date created : 2014-09-14",

We won't be seeing the smarwatch until next year, and Apple is still keeping a few of the details under wraps, including the specs and price.But one source claims to know what the internals of the smartwatch will be. The word comes from analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company, who quotes a source from Apple's supply chain.Apparently, the component creators believe the wearable will pack in 512MB of RAM and offer 4GB of RAM as standard, which puts it on an equal footing with the top Android Wear devices out there right now, such as the Samsung Gear 2 and the LG G Watch R.Arcuri also says that Apple might be offering an 8GB version of the watch as well, though it's unclear whether this information also comes direct from the source - or whether it's speculation on his part.Juice it upFinally, Arcuri also says he expects the Apple Watch to feature a wireless chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 5S, which actually included a GPS radio. However, that would contradict Apple, which stated that the Watch will need an iPhone in order to use GPS, so we'd say it's less likely.Speaking of chips, Chipworks has provided a visual teardown of the Apple Watch internals, and it reckons it's spotted the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip that Cupertino has chosen for its debut wearable.The important takeaway point is that, if Chipworks is right, the BCM4334 chip used will mean the watch should offer minimal power consumption in the connectivity department.However, the word right now is that Apple's smartwatch battery will last a day in its current state, so the company might have to look elsewhere in the watch if it wants to insert a little more juicepower before launch.Apple's watch is still in prototype right now but we don't expect too many of the specs to change before next year. If anything does, we really, really hope it's the battery life.",

   "text": "A PGA Tour golfer said he has sources who tell him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one-month suspension for PED use. Tiger Woods has had a tough career as of late, plagued with injuries and surgeries that have complicated his strong golf swing, and now that he’s taken “a leave of absence” until his golf game is “tournament ready,” he’s facing criticism.MORE FROM GOLF3/2 - Tiger Woods’ Agent, PGA Refute Claims Of PED Suspension3/1 - Rickie Fowler And Kid Rock Give Advice To Tiger Woods2/28 - Ian Poulter’s Caddie Chases A Duck (Video)2/27 - Rory McIlroy Thinks U.S. Is Desperate For Ryder Cup Win2/25 - Yahoo Fantasy Golf Picks: The Honda Classic 2015This criticism blew up Monday morning when professional, but not well-known PGA Tour golfer Dan Olsen went on a radio interview with David “Mad Dog” DeMarco on 730 WVFN’s The Game in Lansing, MI and claimed that Tiger Woods is serving a suspension for using PEDs.“I heard he’s on a month suspension,” Olsen said. “And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”WOW. Dan Olsen, who are you?Olsen’s dislike for Tiger Woods must be really strong if he’s going to go on radio and make wild claims that haven’t been evidenced by anything or anyone else.As if this wild claim wasn’t enough, Olsen went on to basically say that Tiger is just one big cheater and dragged Rory McIlroy into it.“Tiger, he’s got some problems now,” Olsen said. “One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”Again, wow. Dan Olsen is going all in on Tiger Woods, staking his reputation (which obviously isn’t much because most people have never heard of him) to call out Tiger as a cheater.It’s a tough claim to believe, and one you don’t want to believe, either. Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers to play the game and when he’s done he’ll be remembered as the best.Tiger has played two PGA Tour events this year and he missed the cut in Phoenix in January and withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open in early February after suffering back pain. Because of his back surgery last summer, I guess it wouldn’t be shocking that Tiger would take PEDs, but IF he even has, they certainly haven’t helped him at all. And Tiger is a veteran, he knows about drug testing and he’s gone through it his whole career.The claims by Olsen, who has played in 35 PGA Tour events in his career with no top ten finishes, seem farfetched and forced, but you can’t discount them completely. We’ll see if this prompts Tiger Woods or the PGA of America to make a statement denying these facts or coming clean on something that may or may not be true.",

The insurgents themselves never use the term.The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means \"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad\".He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began.Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced.Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace.Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand.But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace.",

   "text": "On Friday, Esquire published an article titled “ESPN Has A Problem With Women” that suggests the network was planning to host a male-only panel discussion on domestic violence during this week’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast.The article begins:On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.These people are not allowed at the table.The assertion that ESPN would host such a panel discussion and not invite any women to participate sparked outrage.THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/lasYPHtbXlUtterly speechless. RT @Lahlahlindsey THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/ycDWFvwtfI …Chris Berman and Mike Ditka, who are not good at talking about *football,* talking about domestic violence? This has a chance to be A+ TV.Several other blogs wrote posts questioning why ESPN would only let men participate in this domestic violence discussion. (H/t Deadspin)ESPN Doesn’t Get It: They Ignore Women’s Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic ViolenceESPN’s Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight’s ESPN Domestic Violence PanelEsquire writer Ben Collins who posted the original article took to Twitter to attempt to clarify what he wrote.Hi, everybody now reading my ESPN story @Lahlahlindsey's tweet! Note: There's no special panel on tomorrow's Countdown for domestic violence...Those are the people on the show every week. They haven't changed it in the last few weeks, either. Don't know if that's better or worse.But there was a top sentence left off that tweet that's going around, and I wanted to clarify. ESPN is mad enough at me as it is. Thank you.On Monday, ESPN’s John Wildhack, executive vice president of programming and production released a statement refuting Esquire’s original report that the network scheduled any sort of domestic violence panel discussion.Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.ESPN published a blog post highlighting reporting on domestic abuse by its female staffers since the Ray Rice scandal broke last month.ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence.ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire’s domestic violence panel story.ESPN is about to release a statement. I'll go through a few points here. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.Since the Rice story broke, ESPN has featured several women prominently, including myself, @katefagan3, @SarahSpain @jemelehill etc.Tonight's regular MNF panel will be hosted by Suzy Kolber. It was never meant to be a single-issue discussion of domestic violence.Esquire did not immediately return a request for comment.",

   "text": "Batman as Steve Jobs? Sure. How about that guy from Superbad as Woz, too?Seth Rogen has reportedly signed on to star as Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs film from Sony. You know, the as-yet-untitled biopic written by Aaron Sorkin, creator of \"The Newsroom\" and \"The West Wing.\"The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.Sony's flick would be the fourth such feature film that's either in the works or has already been made about Jobs, sharing the marquee with 2013's \"Jobs\" (the one with Ashton Kutcher), \"iSteve\" from the same year (the one made by Funny or Die), and 1999's \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\" (the one where the iPhone hadn't been invented yet). One might argue that the world is a bit Jobs'd out, but we suppose it depends on the strength of Sorkin's script and Danny Boyle's directing.On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO—titled simply, \"Steve Jobs\"—which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011.If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se.\"It's not a biopic; it's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that. He's a fascinating guy—part hero, part antihero,\" Sorkin said earlier this year, as reported by Mashable.\"I don't want to make any news or make anyone feel like I approached the movie in a different way. I'm going to make the movie speak for itself. But he's a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life,\" Sorkin said in a separate interview.Rogen isn't officially on board just yet, per The Hollywood Reporter, and it's unknown whether an official offer has been made or even if any kind of negotiations have taken place. Bale is supposed to be in the midst of negotiations to appear as Jobs.Leonardo DiCaprio was first tapped for the role of Jobs, but dropped out earlier this month to take a role in \"The Revenant.\" After that, DiCaprio plans to take a long break from acting, according to The Hollywood Reporter.",

The London rapper, Abdel Majed Abdel Bary, is the 23-year-old man believed to have beheaded Foley on the video that was seen worldwide last week, according to Fox News on Aug. 24.Bary, who was big into the London rap scene was heard on the BBC radio with his music, but he left London last year to go to Syria and fight with the ISIS. Bary is identified as one of the group that consists of at least three British-born ISIS fighter, dubbed “The Beatles.”The Israel Times reports today that Bary’s songs were featured on BBC radio in the past, as he was at one time a popular rapper going by the name Jinn Matic. Those recordings of his songs that once played on the radio are a treasure trove of data used by the investigators today.Britain used high tech voice recognition to identify “Jihadi John,” the man seen in the video with Foley, reports the Telegraph. Bary’s recording music has been of vital importance when using the high-tech equipment to identify the voice on the video. His songs like Dreamer, Flying High and Overdose were hits on the popular BBC radio, but they are important pieces of evidence today, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.While news that Bary was suspected to be the man seen on the video beheading Foley hit early this weekend. On Sunday morning it is confirmed that he is the main suspect and not just one of many.Dressed all in black with a mask covering his face, the executioner beheaded James Foley, an American journalist, on a video that was later posted on YouTube by ISIS. Barry was seen early this month on YouTube holding the severed head of one of his victims, so there’s no question about him being very capable of what many see as pure evil. The beheading of James Foley is not the end of the violence from this group warn officials.",

That came after rumors spread online and through several media outlets on Dec. 31. Most of them cited anonymous medical sources in the city of Mosul, which has been under the control of Islamic State militants since June.The virus spreading through Iraq would have raised concerns for both the local population and American troops who recently began training the Iraqi military. According to the discredited reports, the virus was said to have been brought to Iraq by militants and other migrants coming to the country from Africa.Health officials said that simply isn’t true. The Ministry of Health and World Health Organization investigated the reports through surveillance networks and contacts with medical sources in Mosul, and found that there were no cases of the virus.“The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus,” according to the joint statement–a question that was raised by skeptics when the rumors spread last week.Here’s a sampling of tweets on the rumors before the announcement:Iraqi News: “Two case of Ebola reported in Mosul”.

Apparently, his desire for secrecy does not apply in this case, as he openly expressed his frustration about the Episode VII leaks.Adamant about the project’s secrecy, Disney is reportedly taking Abrams’ request very seriously and is looking at a possible summer release. This would put Star Wars up against other giant franchise releases, namely Jurassic World and Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron. Does this make sense for Star Wars' highly anticipated return to the silver-screen?Earlier this week, Disney issued a subpoena over Star Wars: The Force Awakens leaked photos. This indicates that the company is taking measures to prevent further leaks, making Abrams’ desire to move up the current December 18th, 2015 opening date a very real scenario.Does this mean we are in the final stages of post-production?

The FBI is evaluating a video that was posted online Tuesday, purporting to show Foley's beheading.That video was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday afternoon and later removed. The images show a man resembling Foley kneeling next to a masked militant, reciting comments against the U.S. before being killed.U.S. officials tell the Associated Press that Islamic State had recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge U.S. airstrikes that have helped Iraqi forces regain key sites, including the Mosul dam.The Islamic State also says it's holding another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in Syria last year, and that Sotloff could be the next victim.National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says U.S. officials are studying the video to determine whether it's genuine:Foley has been missing since November of 2012, when he was kidnapped while reporting in Syria for the news organization GlobalPost. A Facebook page was later created to call for his return; last night, it posted this statement from Foley's mother, Diane:GlobalPost notes that, \"The Foley family has not received confirmation of Jim's death from the U.S. government, and acknowledged that there is still a small chance the video of his apparent killing will prove to have been fake.\"The company's CEO and co-founder, Philip Balboni, says GlobalPost had been working to learn who kidnapped Foley, and where he was being held captive.\"Although GlobalPost's investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic militants in Syria,\" Balboni said. \"We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.\"Foley was on a freelance assignment for GlobalPost when he was abducted in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He had been making his way to the Turkish border when he was stopped by a group of armed men, the organization says.Back in 2011, Foley was one of three journalists who were held captive for more than a month after being attacked by Gaddafi fighters near Benghazi. A fourth journalist didn't survive the attack.Their ordeal led Foley and one of his colleagues, American Claire Gillis, to visit NPR's Talk of the Nation back in 2011. Discussing the uncertain weeks of their captivity, Foley said they \"turned to a lot of prayer\" and exercise. In the end, he was the last of the journalists to be released, after spending a week as the sole Westerner in the prison.\"I started to have some dark thoughts,\" he said. \"I started to think, you know, maybe they're keeping the American guy as the ace in the hole...

This marks the first officially documented militant attack with the chemical.The Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants’ chlorine gas attack occurred on September 15, in the town of Duluiyah, located north of the capital, according to a Washington Post report.The blast followed an exchange of fire between the militants and the members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, who were guarding the town’s borders.“It was a strange explosion. We saw yellow smoke in the sky,” said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, one of the survivors.The victims talked of the fog that hung close to the ground – a possible indication that it was chlorine, which is heavier than air.The physicians who treated them also confirmed that their diagnosis was poisoning by chlorine gas.“They were panicked; we were panicked,” said Kasim Hatim, director of the hospital in the nearby city of Balad, where the officers were taken. “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.”Image from Google MapsImage from Google MapsA recent statement from the Iraqi Defense Ministry said that the IS had used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” – in roadside bomb attacks and near several water treatment plants where it had gained access to chlorine. Without indicating the locations of the attacks, the statement said that the militants aimed at impairing “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular.”American defense officials were not aware of the September 15 chlorine attack and referred to the Iraqi government for further information.Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council, told the New York Times on Thursday, “The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region.”There have lately been several reports of IS militants using chlorine gas on the battlefield, however, none had been officially confirmed. They appeared after the jihadists seized a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant this summer, whose 2,500 degraded rockets the Iraqi officials claimed unlikely to be fit for use.Earlier this week, reports were circulating that there was a chemical attack in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani on Tuesday. But the chemical agent the IS militants used couldn’t be identified, as doctors lacked necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of complaints made by Kurdish victims and activists.As a choking agent, chlorine was widely used during World War I. Nowadays it is sold legally as a key component in industry, but its use as a chemical weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention.",

We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.’September 11 also marks the second anniversary of the raid of the US Ambassador’s compound in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans – including including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens – were killed.Intelligence reports of the stolen aircraft include a warning that one or more of the planes could be used in terrorist attacks in the region. Another scenario involved using a plane with civilian markings to transport armed terrorists to an airport usually open to commercial aircraft.Al Jazeera reported that the planes are being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade, and it plans to use them in terror attacks.Tunisia and Egypt have stopped flights to and from Libya, and countries including Algeria, Morocco and Nigeria are on high alert.Egypt has conducted limited airstrikes in Libya and is considering increased military action, including ground forces.",

Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word.“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an e-mail to the Fix.No public announcement was made about the word switch.

   "text": "Update at 8:50 p.m. EDTThe militant group that calls itself the Islamic State has released a video that purportedly shows the beheading of British aid worker David Haines.The authenticity of the video, which appeared online Saturday, has not been independently confirmed by NPR.The organization, also known as ISIS, had threatened to kill Haines just under two weeks ago, in an earlier video that showed the beheading of an American journalist. This weekend, Haines' family had issued a public plea to his captors through the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The family asked ISIS to make contact with them.Haines, an international aid worker, was abducted in Syria in 2013. \"The British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the most recent video Islamic State video identified him as a captive,\" the AP writes.The BBC reports that the 44-year-old father of two from Perth, Scotland, was kidnapped shortly after he began working with a French relief agency called ACTED. At his posting there, Haines was \"working in the Atmeh refugee camp ... supplying water, food and tents.\"Over the past decade and a half he'd worked with a variety of aid agencies, writes the BBC: \"He had worked with a German charity on post-war reconstruction projects in Croatia, including housing and demining. He was also involved in efforts to help displaced people to return to their homes. In 2011 he became Head of Mission in Libya for Handicap International,\" an organization that works to help vulnerable people with disabilities.\"The following year he joined another agency, the Nonviolence Peaceforce (NP), and went to South Sudan,\" where he worked as an unarmed civilian peacekeeper.ISIS previously released two videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, which were confirmed by U.S. officials to be authentic. The first video, which showed the killing of James Foley, was released on August 20. The second, which showed the beheading of Steven Sotloff and contained the threat directed towards Haines, was released on Sept. 2.The newest video, like those previous videos, appears to name another Western hostage as a future target.NPR's correspondent Alice Fordham, reporting for our Newscast unit, says the video begins with footage of British prime minister David Cameron. The two previous videos began with footage of President Obama.The man identified as Haines, Alice reports, is shown \"kneeling in a featureless desert in an orange robe.\"The video appears to be recent, Alice says: \"The assailant refers to the bombing of Iraq's Haditha dam a week ago. Another man identified as a British hostage appears at the end as the masked man exhorts Prime Minister Cameron to stop fighting the Islamic State.\"Cameron has tweeted a response, writing, \"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.\"President Obama said in a statement that the U.S. \"strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL,\" and pledged to work with the U.K. and other nations to \"bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice.\"",

Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn’t seem like a stretch.That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it’s hard to say who’s right.

   "text": "Ahead of Monday's media event where Apple is expected to provide final details on the Apple Watch, a new report from TechCrunch details a hidden \"diagnostic port\" inside one of the channels on the Apple Watch where watch bands slip into place. While the port is currently used only for diagnostic purposes, the report argues it could be used in the future to interface with \"smart band\" accessories bringing additional functionality to the watch.The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino is careful to state that he has no knowledge of any plans by Apple to launch such smart band accessories, but the idea remains an intriguing one. Possibilities for such bands include additional sensors, external batteries integrated into a band, and more.Apple revealed a number of high-level details about the Apple Watch at the device's unveiling last September, but even now with a launch set for next month there is still much that remains unknown, including pricing details beyond the $349 starting price. Apple will undoubtedly address many of the details at Monday's events, but some of the technical details will likely need to wait until the device launches and users and technical experts can get a closer look at the device.Update 2:13 PM: The diagnostic port will not be included on the Apple Watch that ships to consumers, according to 9to5Mac.Related roundup: Apple Watch , Tag: techcrunch.com",

Many Chinese people prefer to use an English name, particularly if they conduct business with the West. But the satirical site suggests people should avoid fictional characters, names with the potential for sexual innuendo, or random words like Dragon, Fish or Lawyer, which could come back and haunt you \"if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America\".An English name should \"come with a 'feeling' or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from\", so names such as Satan or Dumbledore are out, the website says. Women are told to think carefully about \"food\" names such as Candy, Lolly or Sugar, which might be seen as \"stripper names\". There's also a lengthy warning about names with sexual connotations, especially when used in conjunction with Dong or Wang, which \"are used as slang for male genitalia... so avoid anything like 'Bunny Wang' at all times,\" the website says. Instead, a \"traditional\" name like Elizabeth, Catherine, William or George is considered a good choice. \"Pick one of these if you're looking for a 'safe' English name, often with implications of wealth,\" the website advises.Correction 9 December 2014: An earlier version of this story said the post came from the official CCTV website.

An Iraqi paper claimed that the virus had made its way into Mosul through jihadists who were recruited out of Africa.However, most of the Islamic State’s Africa-based recruits have come from countries where Ebola has not had a documented presence. It also remains unclear whether Mosul health officials would even have the means, training or education necessary to test for Ebola.

After pushing through the front doors, he ran to the East Room, according to the official, confirming details first reported by The Washington Post.A Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment, but the agency’s director, Julie Pierson, will be on the hot seat Tuesday as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing to examine several issues dogging the Secret Service.In an interview with ABC News, the chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Gonzalez got deep enough into the White House that had President Obama or Vice President Joe Biden been there “they could have been attacked.”Signs of increased security around the White House were almost immediate after Gonzales made it into the complex, including additional barriers outside of the White House gates. In addition, the Secret Service beefed-up foot patrols along the fence line of the White House complex and deployed additional surveillance resources, a White House spokesman said at the time.Gonzalez had been homeless in the nation’s capital for the past three months after 13 years in the U.S. Army, including a tour in Iraq.",

Sources also said that Amazon might use the space to showcase products like its new Kindle tablets, its Fire smartphone, and its TV box, Fire TV.People familiar with the plans told The Wall Street Journal that nothing was set in stone yet, and the company may decide to ditch the idea. However, if Amazon does open the store and has a successful launch, it may open more brick-and-mortar locations in other US cities.Amazon has experimented with pop-up shops in the past — last year, it put Kindle vending machines in malls across the country — but this would be its biggest, riskiest attempt. As The Journal points out, opening up physical locations wouldn't be cheap: Leases, new employees, and managing inventory would all cut into the company's already thin profit margins.Amazon's potential location would be 7 West 34th Street, an area that sees a lot of foot-traffic because of its proximity to the Empire State Building and ample shopping.Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.SEE ALSO:  Here's The Decadent Meal That Won Over Google's Early Employees And Persuaded Them To Hire Their First Chef",

Newborns cannot be given the name, and citizens who bore it before the ban were required to assume new names.South Korean media outlets including KBS and Yonhap News Agency said the name ban was contained in a directive from 2011 which was issued months before Kim Jong Un came to power and was only recently leaked outside North Korea.The leaked document said that “all party organs and public security authorities” should identify residents who shared the supreme leader's name and \"train them to voluntarily change [it],” per The Guardian.People named Jong Un -- said to be a common Korean name for both men and women -- apparently were directed to change their names on official documents such as birth certificates, social security cards and school diplomas.According to the BBC, it was likely that there was “little forewarning” of the name ban, since Kim Jong Un -- the youngest son of predecessor Kim Jong Il -- had been relatively unknown to the general public prior to his ascension to head of state.A South Korean government official this week confirmed the authenticity of the directive, reports The New York Times.“It’s true that in North Korea, they now allow only one [Jong Un],” the official, who was unnamed, told the paper.According to Yonhap News Agency, the Pyongyang regime issued a similar name ban when Kim Jong Il was in power and when his father, North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung, was as well.",

   "text": "On Monday’s edition of CNN Tonight, host Don Lemon released audio allegedly recorded in the Canfield apartment complex at the exact time of Michael Brown’s death on Aug. 9. The audio features a man speaking via video chat about unrelated topics (“You are pretty,” he says at one point). The recording is regarded as such an important piece of evidence, however, because one can clearly hear at least 10 gunshots ring out over the course of the 12-second file — first a group of six shots, then four more.The man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, appeared on CNN to discuss the tape: “I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.” She has since reached out to the FBI, which has sent representatives to meet with Blumenthal and her client. “They thought this would be an important part of the investigation,” she said.“At the time, he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing,” Blumenthal said.CNN reports on what the new evidence could indicate:Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.’”Lemon cautioned: “CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of this tape and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording.",

   "text": "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- A journeyman professional golfer who has spent time recently giving lessons and caddying said in a radio interview that Tiger Woods has been suspended for a month by the PGA Tour -- a claim that the PGA Tour and Woods' agent vehemently deny.Dan Olsen, 48, who last played a PGA Tour event at the 2011 PGA Championship, told 730AM The Game in Lansing, Mich., on Friday that \"I heard he's on a month's suspension ... it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person who is telling me this.''[+] EnlargeTiger WoodsSam Greenwood/Getty ImagesBoth the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour.Olsen, who played only one full season on the PGA Tour (2004), said an exempt tour player told him, but he would not disclose the player and couldn't say he fully believed him. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand.\"It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. \"I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.''Olsen also talked about Woods using a \"cheater ball,'' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays, and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension.\"I'll be looked at as just some crazy f--- nobody making accusations about Tiger,'' Olsen told ESPN.com.Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen. \"There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,\" Votaw said. \"We categorically deny these allegations.''The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters.Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open.\"Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world.\"These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. \"They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.''If Woods failed a test for performance drugs, the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension. And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month. If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties.But if the transgression were severe, a month penalty would seem minor.\"They're not even going to remember the women,'' Olsen said, referring to the personal scandal Woods endured in 2009 which led to a divorce from his wife. \"The women are going to take a distance second place. You're gonna talk about him with Lance Armstrong.''The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year.Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004, one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season.

And soon after that an explosion took place.\"It was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,\" Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. \"I felt suffocated,\" al-Jabbouri said. \"I was throwing up and couldn't breathe.\"In an official statement, the Iraqi defence ministry also confirmed that ISIS had used chlorine gas against its forces. The statement, however, undermined the attack and said the ISIS used chlorine in a \"primitive and ineffective way\".?Back in June, after ISIS captured Al Muthanna facility -- where former Iraq former leader Saddam Hussein stored his chemical weapons -- it was feared that the Islamic State militants may carry out chemical attacks.The use of crude bombs made using Chlorine only proves the extend the terror outfit is ready to go. \"We continue to take all allegations of chemical weapon use — and in particular these recent allegations regarding the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon — very seriously,\" spokesman for the National Security Council, Alistair Baskey told The New York Times.\"We are aware of the reports but cannot confirm details and are seeking additional information. The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region,\" Baskey added.The reports of ISIS' chlorine attack in Iraq comes at time when reports claimed earlier last week that the Islamic State militants used mustard gas on Kurdish fighters in Kobane.The Middle-East Review of International Affairs (MERIA Journal) even released a trove of photographs as 'proof' of ISIS using chemical weapons.",

   "text": "Nasa has raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua this weekend were caused by a meteorite, as the government has said.Nasa said that while a meteorite cannot be ruled out, the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside the capital, Managua, suggest something else was behind the event.Photos showed a crater about 39ft wide in a wooded area near Managua's international airport.The head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office, Bill Cooke, estimated that it would have been created by a blast of roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT.Nasa said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area. About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital.Cooke said: \"For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported … despite the population. So I'm very sceptical.\"There was no word so far of any meteorite fragments being found in the crater.Rosario Murillo, a government spokeswoman and wife of the president, Daniel Ortega, said on Sunday that a relatively small meteorite was responsible for the phenomenon. The following afternoon she said scientists from other countries had expressed interest in coming to investigate.Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said he could not confirm for sure it was a meteorite, but said that \"among the possibilities, it's one of the most likely\". He said he suspects a meteorite composed of rock.Incer said it is possible nobody was looking up at the heavens when the event took place late at night. Residents described it as a loud boom.\"I was walking back home after playing billiards, and suddenly I heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong,\" said Victor Gutierrez, a 38-year-old mechanic who lives less than a mile from the site of the crater. \"I didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.\"Incer and Lindley Johnson, an executive for Nasa's Near-Earth Object Observations Program, agreed that whatever happened in Nicaragua had nothing to do with an asteroid that flew past Earth this weekend.At the time of the explosion, the object known as 2014 RC was about as far away as the moon, Johnson said. 2014 RC's passage close to the planet happened about 13 hours later.Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to \"someone out blowing things up\".",

   "text": "As the secretive state’s leader remains out of the public eye, analysts wonder if Kim Yo-jong has assumed the leadershipWhen Kim Yo-jong, was introduced to the public as a “senior official of the party central committee” in March, analysts speculated that she could one day become North Korea’s most powerful woman.Now, as the country’s leader remains conspicuously absent from public life, it has been suggested that Kim Jong-un’s younger sister may have stepped up to help him manage the daily affairs of leadership while he battles a bout of ill health.Along with Kim’s wife, the former singer Ri Sol-ju, the 27-year-old is one of the country’s most prominent women and has been photographed with her brother on public visits. However, it is her absence from the limelight that some believe adds weight to the theory that she may have taken over some, or even all, of the leadership responsibilities from her brother as he recovers from his “physical discomfort”.“If Kim has indeed been set aside – and nobody outside Pyongyang really knows – then whoever has taken power is not seeking the limelight,” said John Everard, former UK ambassador to Pyongyang.“The visits to factories and military units that Kim frequently conducted have not been taken over by anyone else; they have simply stopped.”“As a woman in a very male-dominated society, the theory goes, she might be reluctant to push herself forward publicly straight away, preferring instead to bide her time while governing from behind the scenes.”However, Everard says though it is “not impossible” that Kim Yo-jong has stepped up to the leadership, “it is as hard to disprove this theory as it is to find anything to support it”.Kim Yo-jong, whose name is also spelt Kim Yeo-jung, is believed to act as an adviser for her brother, as other members of the Kim family have done relatives did previously for both him and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, before him.Her elder sister, Kim Sul-song, for example, held a key role in the party’s powerful propaganda department under their father. Their aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was similarly influential until she fell out of favour last year after her husband – Kim’s former mentor – was executed. She is now believed to be in hiding.In the absence of independent media inside the secretive state, speculation about what lies behind Kim’s absence, and whether he is still in power, continues.“The young leader’s absence certainly does deepen our questions about how their system might change or operate without him,” said Adam Cathcart, a lecturer in history at Leeds University and editor of North Korea news and analysis website Sino-NK.com.He too expressed doubts that North Korea might have quietly seen a woman take supreme power for the first time.“Without Kim Jong-un in the forefront, North Korea’s government [remains] a highly conservative patriarchy run by old men for whom Moscow 1956 is the standard for dangerous liberalism. Regardless of who is in charge, it will keep the world on its toes – one thing that the state does extremely well.”",

She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.’His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’ As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.‘This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today, your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq. 'Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. 'We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. 'So effectively, any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership.'So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.’At this point the executioner beheads Foley, who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back. His body is displayed with the head atop the body.Then in another chilling warning, the executioner holds another man, on his kness with his hands tied behind his back, by the scruff of the neck. A caption claims it is Steven Joel Soltoff.The executioner says: ‘The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.’GlobalPost's co-founder, Charles Sennott told ABC News that there is 'no reliable proof that this execution is authentic.'If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,' Sennott said. 'He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.' The gruesome video clip opens with President Obama announcing the commencement of American air strikes on Iraq against ISIS.'Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,' says Obama in a statement dated, August 7.ISIS, which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group. Sotloff has been missing since the middle of 2013 and last tweeted on August 3rd, 2013.According to his Twitter account he was in Libya at the time of his disappearance.Foley’s family including parents John and Diane, of Rochester, New Hampshire, have publicly appealed for their son’s release over the past two years.Foley was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya.The barbaric beheading comes one day after ISIS militants threatened to attack U.S. targets 'in any place' in a chilling video showing a blood-spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English: 'We will drown all of you in blood'.Unlike Al Qaeda, the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq and Syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate, not spectacular attacks on Western targets.It came as President Barack Obama on Monday announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops, supported by U.S. jets, had recaptured the strategically important Mosul Dam, hailing the offensive as a 'major step forward'.The dam had given the militants control over power and water supplies, and any breach of the vulnerable structure would have threatened thousands of lives.As the U.S. military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces also stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria.Foley, who lived Boston, was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces for six weeks in Libya in 2011.He was released after 45 days following an international campaign by his friends and family.The Foley family from Rochester, New Hampshire, had hoped keeping silent could aid his release from Syria, but early last year decided to appeal directly to his kidnappers, increasingly concerned as they grew increasingly concerned.'We want Jim to come safely home, or at least we need to speak with him to know he's okay,' his father John Foley said in a statement in January 2013 as the Foley family launched a website to publicize his disappearance, 'Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed. To the people who have Jim, please contact us so we can work together toward his release.'James, or Jim as he is known to his family and friends, is one of five children to parents John and Diane Foley. Foley, who studied at Marquette University, Milwaukee, and later studied journalism at Northwestern University, Chicago, has also reported on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.Prior to a career in journalism, he taught reading and writing skills to convicted felons at Cook County Jail in Chicago.",

   "text": "The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (£6,500/€8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed \"back of envelope\" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: \"[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch.\" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being \"solid gold,\" it does say it is \"crafted from 18-karat gold,\" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. \"There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.\" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. \"The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model].\" Gold straps Gruber says a \"starting price\" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition \"is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless.\" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.RelatedApple Watch features were ditched as executives struggled to define its smartwatch purposeLG targets Apple Watch with premium, all-metal Urbane smartwatchApple installing safes in-store to protect gold Watch EditionApple Watch release date is before the end of April, says CEO Tim CookApple retail boss and ex-Burberry chief Angela Ahrendts paid $73.3m in 2014 beating CEO Tim CookApple Watch battery will last less than three hours of 'active use'Impressed by Apple Watch, Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer looks to Silicon Valley for smartwatch helpNew Apple Watch features revealed by 'Companion' iPhone app",

A friend of the woman cleared up her identity for Nuevo Diario.According to her Facebook, the woman is a teacher, but not in Santiago del Estero — she’s from a different city called Corrientes. The man in the video isn’t 16 years old, either.

   "text": "TOKYO — North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized after surgery on both ankles earlier this month, a South Korean newspaper reported.Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the Chosun Ilbo said, citing a recent visitor to North Korea it didn’t identify. The person said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. In an unusual acknowledgment, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort,” and South Korea’s Yonhap News reported he is believed to be suffering from gout.Tuesday’s report comes as Glyn Davies, the top U.S. envoy for North Korea, said the isolated state is neglecting its responsibilities to end its nuclear weapon program. Speaking in Beijing on a trip through North Asia, Davies told reporters Monday it’s essential that North Korea moves toward denuclearization.“Today’s news may even prompt an acceleration of North Korea’s nuclear program, and missile tests,” said Hideshi Takesada, a professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo who specializes in North Korean affairs. “He’ll probably be keen to show there are no issues in the nation’s power structure.”The activities of North Korea’s leader are the subject of intense scrutiny in Asia and beyond because of his family’s dynastic rule, its drive to develop a nuclear arsenal and the secrecy of a regime that faces South Korea across one of the world’s most heavily-armed borders.In fractured ankle cases, a doctor may need to set the broken bone back into place with a splint or cast, and surgery may be required to repair the break, according to WebMD, an online medical dictionary. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full pain-free motion and strength, though most people can return to a normal routine in three or four months.Even so, speculation remains in the South Korean media that Kim may be unwell. Footage in July and earlier this month showed the country’s leader walking with a limp, and Kim appeared to have gained weight.Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society.“It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” he said. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flare ups, which cause more pain.”Sometimes the situation is solved, and other times, if the flare-ups keep occurring, the condition becomes chronic, Hepburn said.Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to Britain’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.Surgery may be needed to remove gritty, chalky nodules known as tophi if uric acid crystals build up in joints, according to WebMD.The South Korean government is cautious about making a hasty assessment of the situation given the amount of speculation over Kim’s disappearance from public view, Yonhap reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified government official. People will now be watching to see if he attends the anniversary of the Workers’ Party on Oct. 10., according to the news agency.",

   "text": "The new season of Game of Thrones starts next month, and you know what that means: Cue the mad dash to secure someone's HBO Go password in time. But for cord cutters (and cord never-getters) who want to tune in online, this year may mark the first time they've been able to do so without breaking the rules.HBO is reportedly in talks with Apple to be the launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service that wouldn't require a cable subscription, according to International Business Times. HBO Now, as it's allegedly being called, would cost $15/month and open up access to HBO's film and TV titles to distributors like Apple TV and Roku.HBO's existing streaming app HBO Go is currently available only through a cable subscription. Last year, HBO announced that it would finally unbundle its streaming services from cable in 2015, and the HBO Now launch could be signals that HBO is making good on that promise.It's unclear how the HBO Now library would measure up to HBO Go's current offerings, but the companies are reportedly trying to wrap up negotiations in time for the Season 5 premiere of Game of Thrones next month. So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service.At a price point that's double the monthly fee for both Netflix and Hulu, the new service had better deliver on quantity, as both services offer robust streaming libraries of their own. However, while the quality of the content on those services can vary wildly, the HBO brand is known for its acclaimed original series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under.Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service—but HBO has deflected the matter for years.Presumably, the HBO Now launch must navigate the complexities of HBO's longstanding relationship with cable carriers—Time Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly makes 70% of its profits from cable subscriptions. But if the current negotiations with Apple are successful, the Now service could be HBO's first crack at making good on its promise to cord cutters.",

An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty.Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005.The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused.Verma’s case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.The Minister has taken serious view of in-action since 2007 and directed the concerned to fix responsibility for delay in the matter",

Both manned aircraft and unmanned drones participated in the attack.The Pentagon said no U.S. ground troops were involved in the operation.\"The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,\" Kirby said in the statement released Friday.The United States has backed the Somali government, which has pushed the terrorist groups out of Mogadishu. Despite the government successes, the terror group has been able to operate in parts of the country that remain out of the reach of the government's influence.The White House said it would continue to pursue the organization.\"Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal –- financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military –- to address the threat that al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people,\" the White House said in a statement.",

   "text": "A 280 pound catfish was caught by a fisherman in Italy. According to USA Today Sports, Dino Ferrari caught the huge fish in Po Delta. While the catfish caught by Ferrari was 8.7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds, the largest catfish ever caught weighed 300 pounds. That does not mean that this wasn’t a record-breaking fish, however. According to the report, this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod.According to the San Antonio Express-News, any catfish over 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare. Ferrari isn’t some small time fisherman, either. According to Grind TV, the Italy native is a pro at catching big Wels catfish, and many of these fish frequent the waters where Ferrari casts his line.“The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.”The 280 pound catfish is certainly a sight to see, as it looks as if it could swallow Ferrari whole. He posed for photos with the fish, clearly very proud of his catch (even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures), which took him a tiring 40 minutes to reel in. It is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big!Animal lovers may be happy to know that Ferrari did not keep the catfish, nor did he sell it for money. After his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature, the guys released it back into the river, where it swam off, happy to live another day.As previously reported by the Inquisitr, these Wels catfish aren’t exactly harmless; this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into. And it is definitely not a “gentle giant” by any means.“Dino’s monster catch is not the sort of fish you’d want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping. The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path. These surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold-blooded killers.”Pictures of the 280 pound catfish are making waves on the internet today. Have you ever seen a catfish so big? Would you want to see a Wels catfish in person?[Photo courtesy of Sportex /Facebook]",

   "text": "THE spy agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the British fighter suspected of murdering the US journalist James Foley, British government sources confirmed yesterday.The masked man with a London accent, who is said to be known as Jihadi John, was seen in the shocking video of Foley’s death released by the Islamic State extremist army last week.While sources gave no details of the man they have identified, a key suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, who left his family’s £1 million ($1.78m) home in Maida Vale, west London, last year. He recently tweeted a picture of himself holding up a severed head.The intelligence agencies and police estimate up to 20 British extremists a month are now travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State. The rate has risen since Islamic State declared a “caliphate” eight weeks ago. US ­officials said America was considering carrying out drone strikes on Islamic State leaders in Syria as it steps up its activities in the country, and could also provide more help for moderate rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad.Pentagon sources claimed President Barack Obama agonised for weeks over whether to authorise a mission to rescue Foley and other foreign hostages. Delta Force commandos finally launched the mission on July 4 but the hostages had been moved.“They were ready to go in June to grab the guy and they weren’t permitted,” said Anthony Shaffer, a former lieutenant colonel who worked on covert operations.Writing in The Sunday Times yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond accused Foley’s killer of “an utter betrayal” of everything the British people stand for. “It is horrifying to think that the perpetrator of this ­heinous act could have been brought up in Britain,” he wrote.Mr Hammond said Foley’s death was “a reminder to us all that Islamic extremism in Iraq and Syria is not only causing huge suffering in those countries but is also a barbaric ideology threatening us at home”.Unless Islamic State is stopped, “sooner or later they will seek to strike us on British soil”, he wrote.The comments are the most ­explicit warning yet from a British cabinet minister about the risk of an attack against the country.The British government, he wrote, was “investing significant resources to tackle this problem for the long term” and to disrupt Islamic State’s ability “to organise, raise funds and attack us here in Britain”.While “we must support the overwhelming majority of British Muslims who are moderate, law-abiding people with values and morals we all share ... we should be in no doubt that we have a vital ­national interest in tackling the threat from Islamic State,” he said.Government sources insisted that while the option of British air strikes on the jihadists remained on the table, they “are not being actively considered or proposed at this stage”.Military planners are, however, drawing up plans to deploy scores of British troops to help train a “substantial” number of Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.Training will focus on the use of heavy weaponry such as artillery, mortars and Milan antitank weapons.Sources said Britain was exploring the possibility of establishing training camps in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq and in Baghdad, although the high security risk meant the training could take place in Jordan or Britain instead.Additional reporting: MARIE WOOLFThe Sunday Times",

   "text": "Not only has the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic likely found an actor to play Jobs, it may have found an actor to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak too: according to The Wrap, Seth Rogen is being considered for the role. Variety reports more definitely that he's actually set to play it. Rogen would be acting alongside Christian Bale, who is reported to have taken the part of Jobs. Danny Boyle, who made Trainspotting and 28 Days Later, is directing based on a script by Aaron Sorkin. Jessica Chastain is also reported to be under consideration for a part, though it isn't known who she would be playing.THIS ISN'T A DONE DEAL YETRogen is certainly an interesting casting choice, but with how little is known about this movie, it's hard to really gauge what it means. For one, it's not clear how large the role of Wozniak will be: the film is supposed to take place in the moments preceding three major Apple product launches, and Wozniak wouldn't necessarily be around for all of those, having left Apple in 1985. We've also seen successful pairings of strong dramatic actors, like Bale, with traditionally comedic actors, like Rogen, in the past to quite a bit of success — see last year's The Wolf of Wall Street, for example — so it's possible that Boyle is trying to emulate that here.That all said, The Hollywood Reporter says that it isn't clear if an offer has been made to Rogen yet, but that the film's producers do want him on board. The Reporter also says that Bale's deal is yet to close and remains at a delicate stage — though Sorkin has suggested that he's on board. This Sorkin-scripted Jobs film has had a rocky development process and has already had to restart once, when David Fincher was dropped from being its director. Still, it's sounding more and more like the studio behind this film is eager to get it made, so perhaps we'll see some confirmation on all of this soon.",

   "text": "Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an \"outperform\" rating.",

   "text": "U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. \"ISIS is coming across the southern border,\" Hunter said, adding a moment later: \"I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.\"Border Patrol agents \"caught them,\" Hunter also said, but \"you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.\"Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.No federal or state confirmationNo state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources.Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account.Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: \"The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.\"And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it \"does not have any information to confirm\" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity.In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: \"An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.\"On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that \"we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,\" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that \"we know\" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch.For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense.\"It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of \"no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case.\"Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.\"Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,\" Kasper wrote. \"We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,\"  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said.Our rulingHunter said \"at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas\" and there are \"dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.\"No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are \"dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol\" is missing a factual basis.All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

Kim was seen limping in July during a TV appearance.The paper said that Kim was still in the hospital, under heavy protection from bodyguards, and was receiving visits from several government officials.This rumor seems to confirm what North Korean state media had said on Thursday, when state broadcaster Korean Central Television reported that Kim was \"not feeling well,\" and was suffering from an \"uncomfortable physical condition.\"Have something to add to this story?

But Johnson said they were \"scrutinized very, very carefully\" and officials found \"no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.\"Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim.

Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to \"exploit\" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.He complained that the administration has \"widened the loophole\" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would \"legalize visa overstays\" and raise \"the threat level to America even higher.\" He said there is \"no doubt\" many are already being \"targeted for radicalization.\"FoxNews.com's Judson Berger and Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.",

   "text": "The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from West London.The IS frontman is believed to have appeared in a series of shocking videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, are brutally murderedThe 27-year-old was named this morning by the Washington Post and it is understood he is known to British security services.The paper described him as being from a well-to-do family in West London, graduating from college with a degree in computer programming.MORE: Soldier who went to fight in Syria ‘is going to get a smacked bottom’MORE: Desperate plea for missing schoolgirls ‘heading to Syria’A friend said: ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him.’His friend added that he was radicalised after a planned trip to Tanzania following his graduation.British radicalisation experts said they believed the identity to be ‘accurate and correct’.A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College London said: ‘We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.’Dressed all in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, ‘Jihadi John’ reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.It is claimed that he told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.According to the article, in 2009/2010, Emwazi decided to move to Kuwait, where he told friends he had a job and marriage waiting for him – but was prevented from travelling there by UK counter-terrorism officials.Released hostages have told officials that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. He was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ‘George’.The ICSR said: ‘Jihadi John is not special in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.‘The fact that ‘Jihadi John’ has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one’s identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.‘This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.‘British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide bombers, hostage takers, and executioners.’Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met’s counter terrorism command, said: ‘We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.‘We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.’Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi’s name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ‘The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.‘There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.’",

He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.Apple watch versionsApple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. “If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?",

   "text": "Matt Taibbi is taking a “leave of absence” from Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, according to New York Magazine. The move comes “after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar’s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today.”Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi.The “leave of absence” also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats (like, uh, Pierre Omidyar) to a wider mission, involving more comedy than reporting. Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization.I’ve previously had a… uh… spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims, although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were “not for publication” — a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that’s about leaking confidential documents. I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today’s news. He replied: “No, you may not.”Here then, for what little it’s worth, is my side of the correspondence, from back in July, in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it (with a little help from some well placed sources.) The discussion was… uh… spirited on both sides. All words below are mine — you’ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi’s stated position might have been.A note on not for publication / off the record: I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a “not for publication” conversation. Given First Look’s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn’t being entirely truthful about his place at the company, I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses, with Taibbi’s words redacted. I’m sure some readers with disagree — I welcome the discussion.Also, an important disclosure: Taibbi previously worked with Pando’s Mark Ames on Russian ex-pat newspaper, the Exile. It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms. I didn’t discuss this post with Mark before publishing.Ok, here are the emails…[The email thread began with Taibbi's emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy. I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply. Taibbi's email was headed \"Not for publication.\"]From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted Taibbi quote, denying my story] Right, but that’s not the part that seems to have changed. What’s changed is that Omidyar’s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street. It’s gone from finance first to politics first. More broadly, and happy to stay off the record, there’s clearly something weird going on over there. Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it’s launched? It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology.[Taibbi responded, with questions of his own. Here's my reply...]From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 I don’t think [Omidyar] took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over. Knowing what I do about his management style I’m leaning towards the latter. But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what’s going on.[Taibbi responded again. And I replied again...]From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted.] If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I’d never publish a thing about First Look. I’ve given PO 48hrs to respond before, and still got nothing. I’m sure you’ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response? As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments — I didn’t say he’d hired you to shut you up. So, no, I don’t [believe] something you just made up. As you say, that would be real [redacted] analysis. Here’s what I believe… I don’t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you, and I don’t think you’re entirely sure either. Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill. I think you’re tired, and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn’t going to last for ever. I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team. For that reason, I think Omidyar’s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you, and to anyone else who works at FLM. He’s lost his nerve — for a combination of reasons — and is retreating to something he understands: Technology and platforms. I’ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications — if you seriously think he’s going to have your back when you go after his pals you’re more naive than… well, than you are. I’m tired of this conversation now. I honestly can’t tell if you’re being a team player, or if you believe any of this crap. I’m sure I’ll continue to cover FLM and I’ll continue to ask for comment when I do. It’s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter. Either way, I’ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if/when you publish it — just as I read, and enjoyed, your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back. Best of luck, Paul[Taibbi responded again.]From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Wed, Jul 30, 2014 I’m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation. I’ve laid out my position, clearly and honestly, and asked follow up questions. You won’t actually address any of my points — you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I’m saying. At the very least you’ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look: Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said, while refusing to answer questions, and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark. The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis. [Redacted] I’ve told you what I believe, but I’ll humor you — and your enjoyment at playing PR flack — by saying it again, this time line by line… [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think it’s unlikely Pierre *ordered* you to stop writing about Wall Street. I’d say the odds [are] almost zero. He’s not that fucking stupid. Here’s what I said “No, of course I don’t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over.” Here’s my question, which you don’t seem keen to answer: Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be? If not, doesn’t that worry you? If so, what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable? A follow-up question: What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists — Greenwald in particular — insist that Pierre has no control over editorial (indeed you’ve insisted similar in this conversation) and yet he’s the one laying out the company’s editorial plan? Why wouldn’t that be the job of the actual editors? Instead we have your $250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that — don’t worry! — he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs, but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously (in a video starring him) said he would fund. What does the phrase “editorial independence” actually mean at First Look? [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think that’s what he told you when you were first hired, yes. People are told lots of things on first dates. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I’ve never said otherwise. That’s a total red herring. [Redacted Taibbi quote] [Redacted] I didn’t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing (because, as I’ve made clear, I don’t believe that would make any sense); I didn’t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired (because, again, I don’t know. What I know — and what I wrote — is that the public statements about your mission have changed); I didn’t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn’t changed. [Redacted Taibbi quote] A press release about what your job and focus will be, written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired. A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be; specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned. Yes, I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and, yes, I believe that it’s either a choice you’ve consciously made, or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging. Your choice of denial is interesting. “[Redacted]” That’s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre’s business interests. Clear enough to sound like a denial, but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street. Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it’s on politics and “culture”? If the *main focus* of the site still on uncovering financial corruption? Yes or no? If yes, why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post, and if no, why not? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Pierre has been interfering with First Look’s editorial plans from the start. Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre’s pleasure. He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources. How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don’t understand that? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Yes, that is what’s apparent from Omidyar’s statement. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I had plenty of information, and printed what I knew, after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication. I’d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you’d answer any of the questions above. Or better still, stop hiding behind “not for publication.” Why, if you’re being so unfairly maligned, won’t you let any of the above be shared with readers? Isn’t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide? Why doesn’t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner? Which leads me to my last question: Have you, or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge, signed an NDA or non disparagement contract — either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract(s)? You’re right, this is an enjoyable conversation! Now let’s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers. PaulDespite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation, Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look.When I emailed him earlier today, I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments. He replied: “Just that your story was wrong then and still is.”",

   "text": "Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video on Tuesday that shows the apparent beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley — with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to put an end to US airstrikes.Foley, a 40-year-old photojournalist kidnapped in 2012, was forced to recite anti-American hatred from his Islamic State in Iraq and Syria captors as his final words before a masked killer put the knife to his neck.The video — which was posted on YouTube until the site yanked it down — shows Foley dressed in prisoner orange and on his knees in the desert area. His head is shaved. Behind him is a man covered head to toe in black. It’s titled “A Message to America.”“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,” an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist says in reference to US airstrikes in Iraq.A stone-faced Foley — who was last seen on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for Agence France-Presse — then bravely reads a clearly coerced statement.“I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity and don’t accept any meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively put the last nail in my coffin,” he said.“I call on my brother who is in the Air Force. I call on you, John. Think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq. Who did they really kill? Did they think about me you and our family when they made that decision? I died that day, John. When your colleagues dropped that bomb, they signed my death certificate. I wish I had more time. I wish I had the hope of seeing my family one more time.”As a final insult, his last forced words were, “I guess all-in-all I wish I wasn’t American.”The video then shows another American — Time journalist Steven Joel Sotloff — and the group says he is next unless the US backs off.He is being held by the collar as he kneels in the desert, also wearing prisoner orange and a shaved head.Sotloff was abducted in Syria in August 2013. His last Tweet was about his hometown Miami Heat.“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.White House National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said they’re analyzing the video of the beheading to determine its authenticity.“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said.ISIS had warned the US of the potential murder in an earlier video saying, “We will drown all of you in blood” in retaliation for US airstrikes that have been pounding them.Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.US Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said the video reveals ISIS for the true murders they are.“ISIS is the worst of the worst,” King said. “These guys are truly animals.… We have to go after them and destroy them.”Foley family friend Holly Rene, who lives in their hometown of Rochester, NH, told The Post, “These savages have got to be stopped. It’s coming West.”She said the family is “falling apart with grief.“I was just so hopeful Jimmy had, if they weren’t going to get any good news, that he would have been dead for a long time now and there was no suffering involved. And to think he went through two years just to have this ending, it’s beyond belief.”Foley’s family had set up website to plead for Foley’s return — and urged patience on Tuesday.“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the Find James Foley Facebook wrote: “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”Foley, one of five children, had been captured previously in Libya for 45 days in 2011.He graduated from Marquette University in 1996 and later studied journalism at Northwestern University.He penned a letter to Marquette Magazine thanking the community for its prayers when he was captured in Tripoli with two colleagues. He recounted getting to call his mother from prison and learning of the university’s prayer vigil for his release.“If nothing else, prayer was the glue that enabled my freedom, an inner freedom first and later the miracle of being released during a war in which the regime had no real incentive to free us,” Foley wrote. “It didn’t make sense, but faith did.”",

This time, some users are reporting that anybody trying to reset the settings on their iPhone could accidentally delete all of their documents saved in iCloud, Apple's online backup service.MacRumors reports that multiple users of its forums have reported an issue when attempting to reset all settings on their iPhone. Apple informs you as you reset your phone settings that \"no data or media will be deleted,\" but people are claiming that the reset wipes all of their iCloud Drive documents.The existence of the bug is not yet confirmed. We asked Apple for comment but have not yet heard back.iCloud Drive is Apple's online file storage solution for documents. According to the official Apple site, iCloud Drive can be used to \"safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud.\" It competes with DropBox and other cloud storage apps.Forum posts claim that after they complained that a settings reset deleted their files as well, Apple told them the company is waiting on engineers to fix the issue. Another reported that his account was placed in troubleshooting mode as Apple investigated.One poster on the MacRumors forums has this to say about the problem:Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud. I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox.

   "text": "An asteroid about 60 feet in diameter missed hitting Earth Sunday by about 25,000 miles, as predicted by NASA’s Near-Earth Object program.It did not, contrary to some reports Monday, break off a little piece that landed with a bang in Nicaragua.That story was intriguing to asteroid watchers, including the scientists at the Tucson-based OSIRIS-REx project, which tweeted Monday:#Nicaragua impactor: the second serious impact in as many years that was undetected #chelyabinskNASA officials, though, are skeptical that the reported explosion and crater near Managua’s airport was caused by a space object.On Tuesday, the OSIRIS-REx twitter feed was reporting that skepticism.It pointed to an article by Bill Cooke, lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office, who wrote on NASA’s “Watch the Skies” blog that someone would have surely seen the meteor streaking toward Managua, which has a population of more than 2 million.“... the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause. The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.”Steve Larson, of Tucson-based Catalina Sky Survey, said the Managua explosion was also out of sync with the passage of asteroid 2014 RC, which was first spotted and observed by the sky survey’s telescopes on Mount Lemmon on Sept. 1.The asteroid made its closest approach on Sunday at 11:30 a.m. Tucson time. The Managua impact was reported 13 hours before then, Larson said.It would have been a good story — if true.Rich Kowalski, the Catalina Sky Survey astronomer who found 2014RC, had previously spotted two other small objects that later struck Earth, in 2008 and again last January.No one else has done that and this would have been his third one. At OSIRIS-REx, where scientists are planning a NASA mission to capture and return pieces of an asteroid they have named Bennu, asteroids that could turn into meteorites are big news.In addition to bringing back pristine space rocks, the mission also promises to increase scientific knowledge of asteroids and the impacts of various forces on their trajectory — good things to know should we ever need to defend ourselves from a predicted approach.Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx, said the first tweet about the Managua impact was a little embarrassing, but was quickly countered by skeptical ones.He said the mission wants to be immediate and newsy with its social media, but also needs to apply \"some scientific rigor.\"",

The Inquisitr reported that a local militia group stormed the compound and took control.“Dawn of Libya, an organization consisting of militants from several organizations, announced that it had claimed the embassy, which has been evacuated for a month. The group posted a video showing men playing in the embassy’s pool.”Libya is the same country that was the site of the Benghazi scandal that still, though generally has been reduced to distant thunder, is hovering over the Obama administration. The attack took the life of US Ambassador Chris Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty.Reports indicate, that a major Libyan airport in Tripoli was overrun terrorists, and 11 planes went missing last month. Magharebia reported on August 20 about the missing Libyan planes.“The Tripoli airport siege led to the disappearance of several commercial planes.

The official went onto to say:“The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.”A State department official dodged the question concerning legitimacy of the report, according to the Washington Times, and stated “I can’t confirm that”.Joint military exercises, as of August 20, have begun to include simulations to intercept a passenger or military plane that is piloted by terorists, Magharebia reports.“The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday.”An analyst named Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia:“These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries”The question remains, how should the US respond to escalation of attacks overseas?[ Images Via WikimediaCommons]",

   "text": "What’s wrong with building a snowman? Plenty if you ask a scholar of Islam in Saudi Arabia. A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric apparently issued a religious ruling, officially called as a ‘Fatwa’, forbidding the building of snowmen. According to the cleric the practice is highly anti-Islamic.The religious scholar, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid strongly believes that building snowmen isn’t an acceptable Islamic practice and it should cease with immediate effect. The leader confirmed his viewpoint on a website where one of the members had asked whether it was OK for fathers to build snowmen for their children. To this, the cleric replied in the negative, saying,“It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”Sheikh Munajjid had an explanation ready to back his fatwa. He argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being. Under the Saudi kingdom’s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, such an action is considered a sin. While noting his ruling, he added,“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,”In simpler terms, the cleric was OK with building snow figurines representing anything non-human or animals for that matter. As amusing as it might sound, children might now be left with other “inanimate” objects only. How does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree, isn’t what the religious leader pondered much upon.سعودي يتزوج الثلج ،، الشعب بدأ يفصل شيئاً فشيئاً #snow #wedding in #saudi arabia pic.twitter.com/g2cNzTkGsf— يوسف عبدالله الوابلي (@YOUSEFALWABLY) December 16, 2013Fortunately for the children, the fatwa hasn’t been accorded a date of implementation and moreover, no local government authority has officially confirmed or denied the same. Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa. However, they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of Islam and must have valid basis under Saudi law.The country’s northern regions have been recently lashed by multiple snowstorms leaving in their wake sporadic accumulations of snow that will soon melt away. Despite being the second hottest country in the world snow has covered a few upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia’s border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.إبداعات أبناء تبوك والشمال في فن النحت بالثلج تجلّت خلال أيام البياض الفائتة وهذه أنثى من ثلج تبدو فاتنة بالبياض pic.twitter.com/SE1mjlZUDF— عبدالرحمن العكيمي (@ALOKEMEabdualrh) January 12, 2015Though this is a rare opportunity for children to enjoy the snow, perhaps the cleric has put a severe dampener on their plans to build a big snowman.[Image Credit | EPA]",

ISIS has threatened that Steven Sotloff—another freelance reporter who has been missing since August 2013 and has written for numerous publications such as Time, Christian Science Monitor, and Foreign Policy—will also be executed depending \"on Obama’s next decision\" regarding U.S. military strikes against ISIS in Iraq.In the graphic video, Foley was forced to read a letter encouraging Americans to rise up against his “real killer”—“the U.S. government,” adding that the U.S. airstrikes against ISIS “hammered the final nail into [his] coffin.” Apparently, his executor was heard in the video speaking English with a British accent.",

   "text": "The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border.The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight.Lebanese security officials described the woman as a “high-value catch” and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadi’s DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004.The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports.Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian.“It is close to impossible that she would have operational details,” said an Iraqi intelligence officer. “But she could still be useful on things like locations.”Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraq’s north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britain’s GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (£6.4m) bounty on Baghdadi’s head.Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanon’s military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut.The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border.Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraq’s central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew.Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video’s authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that “the Dane is doing better.”Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria.",

He was made famous in a video showing the death of American captive James Foley in August of last year.In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose.

Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.WHAT THE WASHINGTON POST AND BBC ALLEGEWHY DID HE JOIN ISLAMIC STATE?The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London. They said Emwazi and two friends – a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib – never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.No comment was immediately available from the University of Westminster.WHAT POLICE SAYPolice declined to comment on the reports. “We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counterterrorism investigation,” said Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command in a statement.",

   "text": "(CNN) -- A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month.The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9.The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day, Glide said. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon.\"A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,\" the company said.The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting, which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000.Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing; no charges have been filed.The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording, said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for that individual.The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.The significance of the pauseWitnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown's death, and the pause could be key in the investigation. But it's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting, and that he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car.Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic. Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car, according to a preliminary investigation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.Read the police reportsBrown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car, and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer's gun, Belmar said.Johnson disputes that, saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck, and that Brown tried to pull away. Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car.Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer's version of events.The caller, who identified herself only as \"Josie,\" said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around, taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds.Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots.\"It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,\" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. That incident occurred in North Carolina.But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.\"To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,\" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's \"Crossfire.\" \"Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' \"Complete coverageCNN's Holly Yan and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

   "text": "THE beheading of American journalist, James Foley, at the hands of ISIS militants shocked the world but forensic experts have revealed the video was probably staged, with the murder happening off camera.The UK Times reported that an international forensic science company, which has worked for police forces across Britain, said there is no question Foley was beheaded but that camera trickery and post-production techniques look to have been used.“I think it has been staged,” said one expert in visual forensics, after he was commissioned by The UK Times to examine the footage.“My feeling is that the execution may have happened after the camera was stopped.”Aymenn al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum think-tank, said over the years ISIS militants have improved the production quality of their videos.The analysis by experts has highlighted a number of inconsistencies that could suggest that the beheading of Foley, which was seen on the video, was not his actual death.Firstly, no blood can be seen, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times. Secondly, sounds allegedly made by Foley do not appear consistent with what may be expected.The forensic analysis expert said that no incision could be seen on Foley’s neck, though the right hand of the jihadist partially blocked the shot.While the forensics company, which asked to remain anonymous, did not reach a definitive answer they did conclude that at some point an execution of Foley did take place.British Intelligence has identified the ISIS killer of American, Abdel Majed Bary of London, England! pic.twitter.com/FEEy1iHk0J— DR.

And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray,” Foley said in the letter.“I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.”Foley goes on to describe his hopes of attending his sisters wedding and his plans to take his grandmother out when he returns home.“Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita’s when I get home. Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.”The full letter can be read here.Yesterday, British security services MI5 and MI6 reportedly identified a British hip-hop artist as the key suspect in the hunt for the killer who beheaded American journalist James Foley.The Sunday Times newspaper said Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, from Maida Vale in West London, had become a crucial part of the investigation.The paper attributed the information to “senior government sources.”Bary, 23, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges in New York tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John”.In June, The Sunday Times revealed a threat made by Bary on Twitter. “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels),” he wrote. “Beheadings in your own backyard soon.”Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled Overdose, Flying High and Dreamer.But he was reportedly radicalised by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush West London home last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.Also under investigation are Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, the MailOnline reported.Mail Online reported that al-Britani was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.Since joining ISIS’ brutal campaign in Syria al-Britani, real name Junaid Hussian, has worked to fund the ISIS war chest by mounting jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities.Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, meanwhile, is active on social media using Twitter to post pro-ISIS propaganda. According to Mail Online, he is believed to be behind an account on the ask.fm social media site giving young people advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and encouraging them to join the jihad.Other possible identities for “John” include the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and travelled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, the Daily Mail reported.Still flying high even though the disbelievers hate it☝️ pic.twitter.com/fW4vTED2CZ— Abu Abdullah Britani (@AbuAbdullah_RT) July 5, 2014Still flying high even though the disbelievers hate it☝️ pic.twitter.com/fW4vTED2CZ",

   "text": "BAGHDAD — The Islamic State (IS) has been accused of using chlorine gas against Iraqi soldiers who were besieged in Anbar province. Survivors of an Iraqi army regiment in Saqlawiya, near Fallujah, say the radical group used the gas against the besieged soldiers. There were conflicting government statements about whether the gas had been used.The siege on the regiment, which consists of nearly 400 soldiers, has created an uproar in Iraq, with Iraqi members of parliament (MPs) on Sept. 21 demanding the government break the siege. The following day, the Anbar Operations Command said it opened the road to Saqlawiya, ending the siege of the soldiers. These statements seemed to be an attempt to ease the anger of MPs and the public at security leaders for leaving the soldiers besieged without any support.The incident came shortly after the massacre in the Speicher military base in Tikrit, where nearly 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets were killed. The investigations are still ongoing, as the victims’ families continue protests, blaming security leaders for failing to protect the lives of the cadets.The testimonies of the survivors from the Saqlawiya incident, which were posted on YouTube, have shown the extent of negligence on the part of security leaders toward the soldiers, as well as the lack of serious attempts to save their lives as the siege lasted five days. The biggest surprise in the testimonies was that IS has chlorine gas and used it against the besieged soldiers.The MP in Qadisiyah province south of Baghdad held a news conference in the Iraqi parliament, during which they blamed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces. The soldiers who hail from the province have suffered from the neglect of military leaders, in spite of repeated appeals seeking protection for the service members.MP Ali al-Badri said, “Three hundred soldiers were killed in Saqlawiya.\" Badri, citing survivors’ testimonies, said, “Terrorists used chlorine gas for the first time.”Sabah al-Jouburi, a professor at Salahuddin University in Salahuddin province, said IS had used chlorine gas in its war against the army for the first time.Reports previously suggested IS has over the years obtained chemicals to be used in its war against the Iraqi government seize cities. Hisham al-Hashimi, an expert on terrorist groups, pointed Al-Monitor to “the use of chlorine gas by the group [now known as IS] in 2005, in the bombings of a popular market in Abu Ghraib.”Hashimi said, \"In early 2014, IS was able to obtain large quantities of chlorine gas when it took control of water treatment plants in Fallujah and Saqlawiya, and in Mosul and Salahuddin following the fall of Mosul on June 10.”Yet, Hashimi said it appeared that IS had not used chlorine gas “in any direct or indirect fighting” with the army. He said IS knows the gas is not that toxic, “can only kill in enclosed places, and loses its effectiveness when heat is generated from the explosion. It can only be used to induce intimidation.”“Experts have not been able to prove its use in the battles of southern Dalouiya and Saqlawiya,” he added.Anbar police also said that chlorine gas had not been used on the soldiers in the province.While Maj. Gen. Ahmad Saddag al-Dulaimi, Anbar’s police chief, told Al-Monitor by phone, “We heard news that IS used chlorine gas in the Anbar battles,\" he said, \"This news is unfounded, and chlorine gas has not been used during the battles at all.” He added, “If it indeed had happened, we would have told all media outlets about it and announced it.”On the other hand, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said, “Terrorist organizations used chlorine gas in some areas close to water treatment plants, but did not have an impact. For the gas to have a lethal effect, it should be used in mass quantities, which the enemy does not currently have.”Although the ministry asserted that “no injuries were reported for now in the regions where the organization used chlorine gas,” it issued instructions “for the purpose of increasing security measures.”In a statement obtained by Al-Monitor, the ministry advised the members of the armed forces and civilians to “cover their faces with a wet cloth to protect themselves from the potential effects [of chlorine gas]” in case they hear IS is using it.",

We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.\"Jose Millan, of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: \"We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population.\"All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event.\"Nicaragua said it would be asking for assistance from international scientists, including those from the United States, to investigate.The composition of the meteorite has yet to be determined and it was not clear if it had disintegrated on hitting the ground or been buried under the ground.Wilfredo Strauss of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: \"We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact.\"You can see two waves on the seismic equipment). First, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit Earth, and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound.\"Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua's First Lady and Government spokeswoman, said the object \"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.\"In February 2013 a meteor that had not previously been detected by scientists exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: \"The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth raises some interesting questions.\"Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.\"If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there.\"",

   "text": "London, England — The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky’s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.“We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said. “We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy’s identity.“He’s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he’ll continue to do,” Invader said. “For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.”After today’s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy’s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.“If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can’t imagine that he’ll be the only one to go down in all of this,” Hawes said. “All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It’s such a shame.”Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.“I’m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,” Fappy told CNN. “I’m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil’s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil’s playground.”Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.“What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn’t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.” Williams continued, “This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they’re on and if they’re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops’ faces and the rest of the government as well.”“People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.”In 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.As soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting “I’m Banksy!” and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.Horner was born in Liverpool is a city in Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow. For anyone with more information on criminal charges that could be used against Horner, London working alongside the United States have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325.",

   "text": "Supporters of Islamic State have claimed that an American aid worker held hostage by the militant group has been killed in a Jordanian air strike intended to avenge the burning to death of a captured Jordanian pilot.A statement posted on a website sometimes used by Isis fighters and their supporters said that Kayla Mueller, 26, had been killed by a missile strike during a bombing raid by Jordanian planes on the Syrian city of Raqqa early on Friday.Mueller died when rockets partially destroyed the building in which she was held, the statement said, adding that no Isis fighters were killed in the attackSeveral pictures of a damaged building complex were included in the statement which they said showed the aftermath of the air strike, but the claim that Mueller had been killed could not be independently verified.“The criminal crusader coalition planes targeted sites outside Raqqa city today at noon time while people were performing Friday prayers,” the message read.“The raids continued on the same site for more than an hour. God has disappointed their endeavours and foiled their plot by not hitting any jihadi man thank God.”The Isis communique used Mueller’s full name and included her US contact details, which had not been made public by the media at the family’s request.Last week the militant group prompted outrage around the world when they released a video of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh being burned to death.In response, Jordan’s King Abdullah vowed to step up his country’s role in the US-led coalition against Isis, promising to wage “relentless war” against the militant group which has taken control of a wide swath of Syria and Iraq.Jordan announced that it sent tens of fighter jets to hit Isis targets in Syria on Thursday, including what they claimed were ammunition depots and training camps. Jordanian jets carried out a second wave of air strikes against Isis targets on Friday.Jordanian officials seemed to cast doubt on the reports of Mueller’s death. Foreign affairs minister Naser Judeh, said on Twitter: “An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.”State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said she could not confirm the report, but said that “a number of Americans” were being held by Isis.Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said: “We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports.”“We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates Isil’s claim,” she said, using another acronym for the group.Mueller, originally from Prescott, Arizona, was seized by Isis fighters in August 2013 as she left a hospital run by the Spanish branch of Medecins San Frontieres in Aleppo.The aid worker had traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border in December 2012 to work with groups providing support to Syrian refugees, a family spokesperson said in a statement.She had spent the previous four years working for various aid groups in India, Israel and Palestine.An unaffiliated citizens group in Raqqa who have proved reliable in the past told the Guardian they believed the claims of Mueller’s death were true, based on comments by Isis fighters.But given the extent of the damage to the building complex shown in the statement, it is unclear how other Isis fighters could have escaped alive unless the hostage had been left unguarded.Unusually for Isis, the militants did not provide footage or photographic evidence of Mueller’s purported death as it has done with previous hostages.Over the past seven months, Isis has killed three American hostages: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. All three men were on camera, and video of their killings was posted online.Two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, were killed in December, as were two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.John Cantle, a British journalist, is believed to still be in Isis captivity. Cantle has appeared in several Isis propaganda videos, the last of which was disseminated online in early January.A second female western hostage is believed to remain in the hands of Isis militants in Syria. In contrast to the nine male hostages and Kasasbeh, neither Mueller nor the second female hostage have ever been shown on camera or in propaganda imagery distributed by the group.Isis is believed to have previously released misleading reports on the fate of their captives. The group maintained that Kasasbeh was still alive throughout a prolonged – and eventually fruitless – attempt to negotiate a prisoner swap involving the two Japanese hostages and Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber who had been on death row in Jordan since 2008.The group’s media outlets released the video of Kasasbeh’s death on Tuesday, but Jordanian officials belief that he had been killed about a month earlier. Rishawi was hanged on Wednesday, hours after the video was released.Mueller, who graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009, had long made helping others a priority, according to the Mueller family spokesperson, who cited years of social welfare activities at home and abroad.In a story in her hometown paper, the Prescott Daily Courrier, Mueller said she felt drawn to help after learning more about the situation in war-torn Syria.“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. [I will not let this be] something we just accept,” Mueller said. “It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”",

   "text": "According to a news source from Taiwan, the mass production stage of the Apple Watch will not begin until January.In addition to the delay in start of mass production, the G for Games blog also reported that the Apple Watch will instead be assembled by only one supplier, as opposed to the two suppliers that was previously rumored.The information about the January start of mass production was revealed [in Chinese] by AppleDaily, which adds that the reported time frame of the start of mass production will make questionable Apple's statements that the Apple Watch will become available to the public by early 2015.The Apple Watch was unveiled by Apple on Sept. 9, in the same event where the company unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The device is Apple's first entry into the wearable technology market, wherein rivals such as Samsung and LG and startup companies such as Pebble have already established their presence.In the event, Apple said that the Apple Watch will begin to be sold to the public in early 2015 without specifying a definite time frame. However, if Apple really does intend to release the device early next year, mass production should already have started.AppleDaily's report of a January start date for the Apple Watch's mass production could mean that the delay was due to the suppliers that Apple tapped for the device.Earlier rumors suggested that two suppliers will be assembling the Apple Watch, namely Quanta Computer and Inventec. However, AppleDaily's report specifies that Quanta will be the only supplier to Apple for the device, with Inventec being removed from the process due to reasons that have not been made clear.Quanta has started its preparations for the mass production of the Apple Watch, increasing its workforce to a total of 4 million employees, reported G for Games. There is also said to be an agreement between Apple and Quanta that the Chinese supplier will not be manufacturing smartwatches for Apple's rival companies in the industry.The delayed mass production start, coupled with the sudden departure of a supplier, will make it difficult for Apple to keep its promise of an early-2015 release for the Apple Watch.The delay will only add to the conservative expectations that Piper Jaffray investment firm analyst Gene Munster has on the sales forecasts for the Apple Watch.\"Overall, we believe that the Apple Watch is light years ahead of any other smartwatch on the market, but consumer application may be limited initially until developers begin to create useful applications for the watch,\" Munster wrote. Munster forecasts 10 million Apple Watches sold in 2015, with a selling price of an average of $500.",

It took several days to confirm initial reports that he died in the attack.“The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,” Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon’s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement confirming the mission’s success.Al-Shabaab, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in 2008. Godane claimed responsibility for the attack last year on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya’s capital of Nairobi, in which at least 67 people died. The U.S. has offered a $7 million reward for information on his whereabouts.“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.Godane was among a number of “high-ranking” al-Shabaab officials who were meeting at Dhaytubako, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, when the attack occurred, Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said in a phone interview Sept. 2.Suicide BombingsIn recent months, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Djibouti that killed a Turkish national and wounded several Western soldiers as well a car bomb at the Mogadishu airport that targeted and killed members of a United Nations convoy, according to the statement.Al-Shabaab was responsible for twin suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, on July 11, 2010, that killed more than 70 people, including one American.

   "text": "Read this story in Spanish at CNNMexico.com(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico.It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing.Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery.Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday.Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried, he said, and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them.A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said.The missing students, who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, were mostly young men in their 20s, according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search.\"Help us find them!\" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students.State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers.The police have denied attacking anyone, according to a government statement on their detention.But protesters from the school have said officials aren't doing enough.\"NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL,\" one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said.Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings.\"The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had,\" one student from the school told CNN en Español.Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests.\"To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support,\" he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. \"It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us.\"A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed.Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Español.\"We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over. And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,\" he said. \"It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo.\"The armed men said they weren't going anywhere, ordering the team to open the door.\"Now you are going to be taken, we are going to kill all of you,\" the gunmen said, according to Sanchez.When the teacher refused to open the door, Sanchez said, the men opened fire again.The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive?State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.Since then, evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group, and police connected with them, to the shooting and the students' disappearance, Blanco told reporters Saturday.In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in MexicoFor years Guerrero state, which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation.Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country.A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.",

   "text": "Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet.A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video’s authenticity. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent AmericanThe video entitled “Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” purporting to show “James Wright Foley” on his knees ahead of his execution by a man whose identity is disguised and who speaks with a distinct British accent.At the end of the video, the same person holds up a second person, who is identified with a caption on the screen as Steven Sotloff, a journalist kidnapped in 2013, and says: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”Last week, social media accounts controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, uploaded videos showing dozens of beheadings of individuals they accused of being sympathisers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, in the northern Syrian town of Deir Ezzor.The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq.The immediate aim of the strikes was to back Kurdish and Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake Mosul Dam, a strategic asset which the militants had gained control of in their recent military surge.Mr Obama has said that Washington will not send troops to Iraq to engage Isis in combat but administration officials have expanded the US military mission there over the last week to halt and push back the militant’s advance.“We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria – most from London – and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials.British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis’ atrocities.The apparent murder of Mr Foley is a violent reminder of some of the most graphic crimes committed by Isis’s predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which gruesomely beheaded dozens of Iraqis and foreigners, uploading videos of the acts to the internet, under the command of the militant group’s then leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, nearly a decade ago.The beheading of American citizen Nicholas Berg in 2004 by Mr Zarqawi himself propelled AQI to the forefront of the war on terror and marked the beginning of a new particularly bloody phase in the Iraqi extremist insurgency in the wake of the US-led invasion.AQI’s other high profile victims included Americans Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, Briton Kenneth Bigley and South Korean Kim Sun Il.Mr Zarqawi was killed in northern Iraq in 2006 in a US air strike, and AQI was subsequently driven underground by a surge in American troops in Iraq and a groundswell of Sunni support – financed by the West – in fighting the jihadi group.The core of AQI’s ideological and operational beliefs and practices has survived in Isis however. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months.Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle.With Isis’ declaration of a “caliphate” in June, however, and with it a direct challenge to what remains of al-Qaeda, many European and American security officials have grown more worried about its international ambitions.Since air strikes against the group by the US began, intelligence officials have grown more worried over Isis’ attack planning against the West.Of the estimated 3,000 Europeans who travelled to Syria to fight against Mr Assad’s regime, the majority have become Isis members and represent a potential terrorist risk to Western states.",

   "text": "Widower Stan Beaton cried tears of joy after telephone engineers found the voicemail recording of his late wife he thought was lost forever.Stan, 68, of Mirfield, was left devastated in December when an upgrade of his phone line by Virgin Media wiped the precious greeting he had kept for 14 years.The retired forklift truck driver took comfort in the voice of wife Ruby, who died of stomach cancer aged 63 in May, 2003.Stan had been assured by the phone company that the recording would be saved after the upgrade and the firm was forced to apologise and offered to make donations to Stan’s favourite charities after the blunder.Red-faced bosses, though, didn’t stop there and put a team of 10 engineers on the case until the recording was recovered.Stan was overcome with emotion when he was played a recording of the voicemail and said: “I felt pure elation and just couldn’t believe it. I thought the recording was gone forever.“I can’t thank Virgin Media enough. Putting 10 people on the job must have cost them a fortune. I am staggered by that.”Stan, who was married to Ruby for 20 years, often used to listen to the voicemail when he was feeling down.He had previously tried to record the message to ensure it wasn’t lost but said: “All I ended up with were blank tapes.”Virgin is planning to send a CD of the recording to Stan and the grateful pensioner has a treat for the engineer who finally retrieved the message.“I’ve got a nice bottle of Glenfiddich with their name on it,” he said.",

Wearing a mask to obscure his identity, the executioner became known by his distinctive British accent, and he was dubbed \"Jihadi John\" by the media.Emwazi became radicalised after graduating from University, and he was known to authorities. He had been stopped and quizzed twice by security services, once in Tanzania and again in Britain. This first detention frustrated Emwazi, according to one friend, who said, \"Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated.\" When it happened again, the friend said, Emwazi wrote to the friend that he felt \"like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.\"Emwazi is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012, where he became responsible for guarding prisoners for Islamic State, the militant Jihadist group also known as ISIS or ISIL that now controls large swathes of the country and Iraq.

Rogen will star opposite Christian Bale, who will play the role of Steve Jobs.The project has attracted top-level talent, as it will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" Sorkin won his Academy Award in 2011 for \"The Social Network,\" while Bale won Best Supporting Actor in 2011 for his performance in \"The Fighter.\"Sorkin's script is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography. The screenwriter has said the movie will consist of scenes that take place before the unveilings of three key products: the original Mac, NeXT and the iPod.Wozniak left Apple in early 1987, which would put him at the company for just the launch of the original Mac. But Sorkin's films are not known to stick closely to historical facts, as seen in his depiction of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" Sorkin himself has said the film will be more akin to a painting rather than a photograph.The upcoming movie will be the second attempt at a Steve Jobs feature after indie film \"Jobs,\" the ill-received Ashton Kutcher vehicle released in 2013.",

   "text": "South Korea newspaper claims Kim fractured both anklesKim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health.But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since 3 September, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?\"© Washington Post",

   "text": "(CNN) -- A woman held by Lebanese authorities is not the wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Iraq's Interior Ministry said Wednesday, injecting further confusion into an already murky situation.The reported detention of a wife and child of al-Baghdadi -- the leader of a self-declared Islamic state spanning large areas of Iraq and Syria -- has spurred intrigue into who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings.But the Iraqi ministry, citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority, said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al-Baghdadi's two wives.Authorities in Lebanon, where the woman was arrested, haven't officially commented on the matter. Neither has the CIA, amid suggestions that Western intelligence was involved in her capture.Before the Iraqi announcement further muddied the waters, the details surrounding al-Dulaimi and her capture were already pretty fuzzy.Here are some of the main areas of interest -- and contention.She's his wife. Or his ex-wife. Or neither.Regional sources close to the capture told CNN that they are certain that Lebanese forces arrested al-Baghdadi's wife.But American sources in Washington gave a different view, suggesting the person detained was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one.Intelligence sources had told CNN that the woman's name is Saja al-Dulaimi. But the Iraqi ministry stated bluntly Tuesday, \"There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi.\"It said al-Dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in Iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings.Iraqi intelligence identified al-Baghdadi's wives as Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal Al-Qaisi.It doesn't help that Baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery.A biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away, stating simply that he was \"married.\" CNN was told al-Baghdadi has two wives. The news agency Reuters, citing tribal sources in Iraq, said he has three.And ISIS certainly isn't confirming anything. Some of its members took to social media Tuesday to deny that any wife of Baghdadi had been arrested.She wielded power. But how much?If the woman is indeed Al-Dulaimi, she is a \"powerful figure\" within ISIS and is \"very active\" in the organization, a regional source with knowledge of the operation told CNN.She was reported to have previously been held by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In March, al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of Syrian nuns, an intelligence source told CNN.But her apparent attempt to cross into Lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al-Baghdadi.\"Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?\" asked Sajjan M. Gohel, the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation.Uncertainty also remains about how much influence al-Dulaimi would have had within ISIS, which is known for its oppressive treatment of women.Analysts say women who join ISIS may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men.But in February, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women.She could reveal vital intelligence. Or hardly anything.The arrest of al-Dulaimi, if indeed it was her, was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told CNN.The source said the Iraqis had help from the U.S. intelligence community, an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation. But in Washington, the CIA had no comment on the matter.Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed confidence that the United States would be able to \"gain some intelligence\" from al-Dulaimi.\"We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,\" he said, referring to recent reports that al-Baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes.Not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into ISIS, though.Expressing skepticism, a former senior U.S. military official told The New York Times that in the Iraq war, the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader or al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' forerunner.\"We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her,\" the unidentified official told the newspaper.And since al-Dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago, what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell-by date.\"In military conflicts, information flows are very immediate, and they become yesterday's news very quickly,\" said Michael Stephens, a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.She was with a son. Or a daughter.The identity of the child with al-Dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports.An intelligence source told CNN that the child was al-Dulaimi's 4-year-old son. Other news organizations, including Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press, also reported that it was a young boy.But Reuters, which originally had reported the same thing, later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter. The New York Times also said it was a daughter rather than a son.Deepening the intrigue, one regional source even told CNN that al-Baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released.The full picture of who exactly Lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealedCNN's Nic Robertson, Jim Sciutto and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

   "text": "Google Inc. (GOOGL:US) bought six office buildings northwest of its Silicon Valley headquarters from Starwood Capital Group LLC and Blackstone Group LP (BX:US) in a $585 million deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said.The properties are part of the Pacific Shores Center office park in Redwood City, California, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Google’s main office in Mountain View, said the people, who asked not to be named because the transaction is private. The company said in its quarterly report filed yesterday that it bought land and buildings for $585 million, without details.The acquisition extends a real estate deal spree as Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, expands hiring and makes acquisitions. This month, the company signed office-lease agreements for a total commitment of about $1 billion through 2028, according to the filing.STORY: Beijing Aims to Reduce Hazardous Smog Ahead of APEC“We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the filing. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.”The company had 55,030 full-time employees as of Sept. 30, up almost 19 percent from a year earlier, the filing shows.Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment beyond the filing. Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment. The Silicon Valley Business Journal reported this month that Google was close to completing a deal at the site.STORY: A Mystery Bidder Offers $3 Million for 6,000 of Detroit's Worst HomesFitness CenterThe properties Google purchased comprise about 934,200 square feet (86,800 square meters) of Class A office space, as well as a 38,000-square-foot fitness center that includes a gym, pool and spa, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than half of the 1.7 million square feet of office space at the complex.The office building addresses are 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800, and 1900 Seaport Blvd., the people said.Pacific Shores Center is a 106-acre (43-hectare) waterfront campus that was developed by San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s. It lies about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. The campus, which includes sports fields and a park, is next to restored wetlands that are part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.STORY: Alibaba Should Buy eBay. Who Wants PayPal?Starwood, BlackstoneStarwood Capital bought Pacific Shores Center in December 2006, near the height of the commercial-property market, from its developer and Walton Street Capital LLC, and immediately resold two of the buildings. Starwood Capital paid about $833 million in the deal, its first office acquisition in the San Francisco Bay area.Blackstone in 2011 bought an $80 million junior loan on the office complex at a discount in an effort to gain ownership if Starwood Capital defaulted, two people with knowledge of the purchase said at the time. Blackstone then gained an equity stake in the properties sold to Google through a loan restructuring.Blackstone, through its Equity Office unit, has major office holdings in Northern California and is the second-largest U.S. office landlord, after Brookfield Property Partners LP.",

   "text": "A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart has revealed a shocking revelation that will change everything you once believed.The 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.Father John Micheal O’neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 minutes later and seems to have perfectly recovered.The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.",

   "text": "Apple is reportedly limiting what Apple Watch apps are capable of doing, ruling out certain features in order to ensure battery life is not too heavily drained in the initial model, which could tarnish the high-profile launch.According to Business Insider, developers working on applications for the new Apple wearable have cautioned that consumers should temper their expectations of what the initial Apple Watch is capable of.The caution harkens back to the initial iPhone launch, when the App Store did not exist, and only the apps pre-loaded by Apple could be used. While the smartphone ecosystem has dramatically changed since then, and Apple’s App Store has proved a template for a new industry, the Apple Watch looks as though it may mirror this model until capabilities improve.The primary issue is battery life, and Apple’s continued attempts to increase the time between recharges. Earlier reports suggested that the device would have only four hours of active battery life, and many of the sensor features initially touted to be included have been cut due to inconsistency.Those sensors that do remain are the source of many of the battery issues, according to Sumit Mehra, CTO of Y Media Labs, an app studio which has been developing content for the Apple Watch.“Sensors take up a lot of battery, and they don’t want every app out there on the Apple Watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life, and then it’s not a watch anymore if I have to charge my wrist every four hours,” said Mehra in a statement to Business Insider.Apple has not yet released its WatchKit SDK for developing standalone apps for the Apple Watch, with developers at the moment limited to creating extensions to iPhone apps that will function on the watch. This helps save battery for the wearable, and means apps can run on the iPhone’s superior processor, but also limits Apple Watch apps to notifications, app extensions and presenting summaries of information – essentially limited versions of what the iPhone can already do.With the expected launch of the Apple Watch less than a week away, and Apple predicting huge numbers of sales for its first ever wearable, consumers might be wise to rethink what the device is going to be capable of, at least for the time being.",

   "text": "Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.The chief of defence staff and a senior presidential aide announced on Friday that agreement had been reached to end hostilities and secure the possible release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls.Air Marshal Alex Badeh said he had instructed all armed forces' chiefs to ensure the \"immediate compliance\" with the development.But a senior army officer in the violence-wracked northeast, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Honestly, we are yet to receive any operational order on the ceasefire.\"As such, we are battle-ready and would confront the terrorists if we see them.\"A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire.On Sunday evening, troops from the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army fought dozens of suspected members of Boko Haram in the town of Damboa in Borno state, witnesses and security sources said.Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\"The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00pm and by 6:00pm, the fight was over,\" added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu.Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 50 miles southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee.The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning.Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire.A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday – after the purported deal – while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger.\"We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all,\" another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday.\"To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags.\"Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state.He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted – an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May.Mr Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area.\"The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00am and serious fighting ensued,\" said Mr Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group.\"We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists.\"Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger.The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks.Edited by Steve Wilson",

The report features a photograph depicting dead turkeys in a farm shed. Texas turkey farm© Depositphotos.com/ bazil  Brief AnalysisThe claims are nonsense. No such incident has occurred in Texas or anywhere else in the US. The story comes from a dubious 'news' site called Daily Buzz Live that publishes a combination of sensationalized but factual news items and outright fiction disguised as news. The 'Ebola Turkey' story is an example of the latter.  ExampleTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys InfectedA Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.Detailed Analysis Story Claims Texas Turkeys Contaminated With EbolaAccording to a story that is flapping vigorously around the interwebs, thousands of holiday turkeys at the Texas Prime Turkey Farm have been contaminated with Ebola. The story claims that an Ebola infected worker on the farm contaminated the turkeys. Supposedly, the CDC has confirmed that 3000 of the turkeys have already been tested positive for the virus and that the farm has been ordered to burn all 250,000 turkeys.The story features a photograph depicting a huge farm shed littered with the bodies of deceased turkeys.Story Is False - No Such Incident Has OccurredThankfully, however, the claims in the story are nonsense.  No such incident has occurred, in Texas or anywhere else.  The report comes from a trashy 'news' site called Daily Buzz Live.

It’s already gotten so bad that editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is wary of entering her personal office. Over the next three days, two other outlets reported even grosser details. You might want to sit down.Radar, for example, said that the rats are actively shitting on staffers’ desks and other belongings:According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture! ... “The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”People, meanwhile, suggested that the magazine’s employees are literally surrounded by rat droppings:“It’s true,” an insider confirms to PEOPLE. “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”How did the rodents penetrate the fashion bible’s new office? Radar confirmed what we’ve heard from at least one other source: The rats let themselves in via 1WTC’s ventilation system:“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”What we currently lack, however, are photos of the damage.

But he didn’t do what online news sites and YouTubers suggest he did.Seidel was reporting from Sugar Mountain, North Carolina Saturday where an early season storm dropped 10 inches of snow. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt introduced Seidel while the meteorologist’s back was turned to the camera. Seidel was hunched over fiddling with something. To an awful lot of people who saw Holt dump out of the live shot, it appeared Seidel was zipping up his pants, having answered nature’s call.The NY Daily news headline taunted, “NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel appears to relieve himself during broadcast.”But that is not what happened at all, said Shirley Powell, the Weather Channel’s spokesperson. Seidel, she said, was using his cell phone as an IFB (that is short for interruptible feedback) which is how reporters in the field get their cues from the control room. The phone lost its signal just as the anchor was introducing the live shot. Powell told Poynter.org that Seidel yanked off his gloves, turned from the howling wind and was dialing the IFB when Holt tossed to him. Since Seidel didn’t have a phone signal, he didn’t know he was on the air. While he frantically dialed the phone, Seidel tucked his heavy gloves between his knees to keep them from blowing away. When he finished dialing, he yanked his gloves back on and turned to the camera but Holt was already calling off the shot and moving on. Seidel was left hanging in the winter wind.“I’m glad for you to tell what really happened,” Powell told me.The crew was using a LiveU mobile live system, which is a backpack sized phone based transmitter andSeidel would not have had a live truck engineer who might have alerted the control room of the communication problem. We still don’t know why the producer in the control booth took the shot live on the air with Seidel turned away.On his Weather Channel bio page, Seidel is asked, “What is your most embarrassing moment on the air?”  He answers “Do you want a list?”  Whatever was on that list before now just took a back seat. And sadly for Seidel, the video will live forever online.",

On Monday some news sites reported on a hoax video of a pigeon pooping on Putin during his speech on the dangers of military aggression while unveiling a monument in Moscow commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War One. The Independent has a good explainer on why the video below is fake. But if it had been real, the symbolism would have been spot on. During his speech, Putin emphasized a strong belief in promoting peace, even as Russia's policies have only provoked and perpetuated violence in Ukraine and Crimea, which he invaded. Despite his words, Russia announced on Monday that it will hold military exercises on its border with Ukraine in a show of strength, according to Reuters. The \"war games\" will include 100 fighter jets and missile practice. According to RT, he called the memorial \"'a tribute to the great deeds,' but also a warning that 'this peace is fragile.'\" He said that \"a peaceful and quiet life\" is the most valuable thing on Earth and that \"humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence. And the way to peace and prosperity is made up of good will and dialogue, and the memory of the lessons of the last wars.\" On Friday, the same day Putin gave his poop-free speech, President Obama called Putin again to emphasize his concern over Putin's support of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. Vice President Joe Biden also announced $8 million in new financial aid to Ukraine to help the country protect its borders.",

I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.“In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically, it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.“In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.”Then, having heard Beaton’s story, a team of 11 engineers decided to try to recover the deleted audio recording.Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, told the BBC the task was like searching for a needle in a haystack.“The chances of its recovery were slim,” he admitted.But after three days of searching, the team found the message on Friday.This is Beaton hearing his late wife’s message after it was recovered:He said afterwards: “It’s just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.”“I’m staggered at the lengths they have gone to.”“They’ve made this old-age pensioner extremely happy,” he told the BBC.Virgin Media is sending Beaton a CD of the recording and the retired forklift truck driver plans on thanking whoever delivers it in style.“I’ve got a nice bottle of Glenfiddich with their name on it,” he told the Huddersfield Examiner.Following the incident, Virgin pledged to make a series of donations to charities of Beaton’s choice as an apology.",

   "text": "Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite, as the government has said.The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital.The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out, the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event.Bill Cooke, head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT.NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area. About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital.\"For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported ... despite the population,\" Cooke said. \"So I'm very sceptical.\"Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed \"2014 RC,\" which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big, or the size of a house.'Fascinating event'Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.\"You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,\" Martinez said.Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about \"this fascinating event\" in the Central American nation, one of Latin America's poorest countries.People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.",

   "text": "Claim: A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin.PROBABLY FALSEExample: [Collected via Twitter, October 2014]Spider burrowed into WA man's abdomen and lived there for three days while he was on holiday in Bali. Ohhhh My Gawwd!Origins: On 15 October 2014, social media lit up with a seemingly implausible tale. An Australian man named Dylan Thomas quickly became the subject of international buzz (via Facebook) after he asserted that during his vacation trip to Bali, a spider burrowed under his skin and had to be surgically removed. Thomas' frightening spider story was picked up by news outlets in Australia, then Europe, and eventually in the U.S. Images sourced from Thomas' Facebook circulated as well via news outlets on Twitter and Facebook:Spider burrows through man's appendix scar and crawls under his skin http://t.co/pbNc9kGcjA pic.twitter.com/DVVTvY5NtC— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 16, 2014Although Thomas' tale spread quite widely, nearly all the initial reports of it stemmed from the same source, an article published by the Australian news site NT News:Bunbury local Dylan Thomas' first trip to Bali was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval [sic] and heading upwards.\"It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,\" he said.Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.Later that morning he awoke to blisters.�That's when it became painful, it was a searing burn,� he said.He finally saw a dermatologist, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan's recent appendix removal.The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days.Moreover, all the information contained in that article came from Thomas himself, thus unleashing on the Internet that bane of fact-checkers: the single-source, self-reported, uncorroborated implausible story. And not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnid-based urban legends that have circulated for more than a century, such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin, but the reporting agency (Australian Nothern Territory's NT News) is one akin to America's National Enquirer or Weekly World News : the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly, sensationalized articles such as \"Obama Gets Croc Insurance,\" \"Frog Gets Struck Down by Lightning,\" and \"Best Man Left Bleeding After Being Hit in Eye by Flying Dildo.\" (The story has since been published by more staid news sources as well.)We've found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin, or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible. Christopher Buddle, an associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, addressed Thomas' claim in an e-mail, saying that the story didn't wash with what we know about spider behavior:I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.As noted, no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered: no pictures of the skin-invading spider have been presented, no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted, and no witnesses to the spider removal other than Dylan Thomas himself have been referenced.Perhaps there's a germ of truth to this story that has been distorted through misdiagnosis or misunderstanding, but in the absence of any other evidence we remain extremely skeptical about the tale as presented.Sources:Davis, Lauren. \"No, A Spider Did Not Burrow Under A Man's Skin and Live There for Days.\"i09. 16 October 2014   McDonald, Dani.  \"Bunbury Local Discovered a Spider Had Burrowed Under His Skin on Bali Holiday.\"  NT News. 16 October 2014    Orr, Aleisha. \"Spider Burrowed Into Appendix Scar, Crawled Through WA Man's Body.\"  The Age. 16 October 2014    Woodcock, Mitchell. \"Bunbury Man's Bali horror.\"  South Western Times. 16 October 2014McDonald, Dani. \"Bunbury Local Discovered a Spider Had Burrowed Under His Skin on Bali Holiday.\"  NT News. 16 October 2014    Orr, Aleisha. \"Spider Burrowed Into Appendix Scar, Crawled Through WA Man's Body.\"  The Age. 16 October 2014    Woodcock, Mitchell. \"Bunbury Man's Bali horror.\"  South Western Times. 16 October 2014NT News. 16 October 2014Orr, Aleisha. \"Spider Burrowed Into Appendix Scar, Crawled Through WA Man's Body.\" The Age. 16 October 2014Woodcock, Mitchell. \"Bunbury Man's Bali horror.\" South Western Times. 16 October 2014",

The new version is slimmer than both predecessors, but sports the same 'tapered' design from top to bottom.But such a slimline frame comes at a price; as Apple appears to have done away with standard USB ports and SD card slot. A single USB Type-C port remains, and the gaps between keyboard keys narrowed in order to minimise space.Four speaker grills positioned between the screen and keyboard double up as ventilation, as the model has no fan. The trackpad is taller than that of the 11-inch model, and the keyboard has been designed to sit edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop, with a notably slimmer margin.UK pricing and the release date of the potential new model remain unknown.The first MacBook Air was introduced by former chief executive Steve Jobs at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo, where he claimed the company had built the world's thinnest notebook.

   "text": "According to a new survey conducted by analysts at UBS, interest in the smartwatch market is continuing to grow ahead of the Apple Watch launch early next year. Of the 4,000 respondents asked to partake in the survey across four different countries, about 10 percent cited that they are \"very likely\" to buy a smartwatch in the next year. Based on projections of Apple's iPhone sales and the current installed base of iPhones compatible with the Apple Watch, the analysts predict Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches within the first nine months.Figure 10 indicates that 10% of respondents (401 out of 4,000) are very likely and 17% (682 out of 4,000) somewhat likely to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. That is a three-fold increase vis-à-vis the 386 respondents claiming to already own a smartwatch and a four-fold increase if we assume that around one-third of the currently owned smartwatches are actually fitness bands.Based on an estimate of 240 million iPhones compatible with Apple Watch being in customers' hands by the end of 2015, UBS suggests this could translate to 24 million Apple Watches sold in the first 9-12 months of availability, depending on supplies.In a smaller survey of customers who registered as very likely to purchase a smart watch, the Apple Watch placed second to the Samsung Gear in buying intentions, although UBS expects those positions to reverse once the Apple Watch becomes available.The analysts also expect the new Apple wearable to redefine the category much like previous products from the company have done for their respective technological categories. Despite first-version limitations in daily charging and iPhone tethering, UBS sees significant potential for the Apple Watch and predicts it will become the spiritual successor to the iPhone in the long-term.Cellular and battery technology is not yet sufficiently miniaturized to fit in the Watch and allow independent functioning. We would think the ability to do so is maybe five years away. In fact, the screen size differential may mean that the Watch and the iPhone will prove complements rather than substitutes. Arguably that is the way the iPad and Mac might be playing out, different products for different jobs.Given that about two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables. With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market. The Apple Watch is set to launch in \"early 2015\", reportedly in the \"spring\" according to an internal video from retail chief Angela Ahrendts.Related roundup: Apple Watch",

Customers will be able to ask specialists to try the different models on, while smaller tables are also supposedly planned so that the Apple Watch Sport and others are better staged.Apple most likely wants to keep the selling experience on its terms until people are more familiar with what an Apple Watch is. The iPhone was exclusively available at Apple Stores and carriers before distribution deals were later struck with Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others.Tim Cook revealed the Apple Watch will ship in April. The exact pricing for Apple Watch an Edition models, as well as launch details, are expected to be announced at an event in March.",

   "text": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua’s government said Sunday that a mysterious boom heard overnight in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua’s airport.A government spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, said a committee that studied the meteorite found that it “appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.”The resulting crater had a radius of 39 feet and was 16 feet deep, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it was not clear if the meteorite had disintegrated or been buried.Residents reported hearing a loud boom on Saturday night, but said they did not see anything strange. “I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing. Then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,” Jorge Santamaria said. “We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.”Humberto Garcia of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua said an asteroid had been forecast to pass by on Saturday. As for the meteorite, he said, “We have to study it more, because it could be ice or rock.”",

   "text": "There were conflicting reports about the outcome of the operationA British-born photojournalist has reportedly been killed by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen during a failed rescue attempt by US special forces.Luke Somers, 33, had been held hostage since being kidnapped in the capital, Sana’a, in September 2013 as he left a supermarket.There were conflicting reports on Saturday morning about the outcome of a joint US-Yemeni operation to free him. Some said an unnamed American hostage had been rescued while others said Mr Somers was dead.His captors had taunted his family after a previous attempt by American and Yemeni forces to free him, saying on Thursday they would execute him within three days if the US did not meet their demands.Al-Qaeda released a video statement from Mr Somers, where he said: “I’m looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I’m certain that my life is in danger.\"Lucy Somers, his sister, told the Associated Press today that FBI agents informed her he was killed in another failed rescue mission but Washington has not confirmed the claim.\"We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,\" she said.She had released a video pleading with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to let him live, describing her older brother as a romantic who \"always believes the best in people\".Mr Somers’ father, Michael, called his son \"a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people\" and asked for his safe release and his mother and brother appealed to his captors to spare him, saying he \"was only trying to do good\".According to a statement on the website of Yemen's defence ministry, a hostage rescue attempt on Saturday morning was successful.A drone struck a suspected AQAP hideout at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, it said, and a subsequent raid freed an unnamed US hostage and killed 10 extremists. It was unclear whether the hostage described was Mr Somers.No further details have emerged of Saturday's operation but the Pentagon admitted on Thursday that a secret raid last month had got the wrong location.Special forces arrived at the target location, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there.The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil.Mr Somers was born in Britain and holds dual US-UK citizenship. Having spent most of his life in the United States, he worked for two years in Yemen as a freelance photojournalist, sub-editor and interpreter for English language newspapers.American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country.Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities.The Pentagon has not replied to The Independent's request for confirmation.Additional reporting by agencies",

   "text": "GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down. The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering. Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip. The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area. Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.",

   "text": "The tale of the Harvard Business School professor who flipped out because he’d been overcharged $4 by a Chinese restaurant took an ugly turn Wednesday night. The Boston Globe’s free Boston.com site, which first reported the story, posted a follow-up claiming that Ben Edelman had sent a racist email to the restaurant owner — and then replaced the follow-up with an “Editor’s Note,” explaining that the authenticity of the email couldn’t be verified. The Boston Herald has a summary of what went wrong.The original story about Edelman, by Boston.com’s Hilary Sargent, had gone viral. Who, after all, can resist reading about a privileged Harvard professor threatening legal action against a hard-working business owner because the prices on his website hadn’t been updated for a while? So when Boston.com retracted its explosive allegation (carrying Sargent and Roberto Scalese’s bylines) that Edelman was not just a contentious jerk but a racist, Twitter exploded.So what did Boston.com publish? It wasn’t long before screen grabs started to make their way around the intertubes. J. Alain Ferry posted a copy here. What happened was that after Edelman apologized to Ran Duan, whose family owns the Sichuan Garden restaurant in Brookline, someone claiming to be Edelman sent another email to the restaurant owner, writing, “You may have won the battle Duan, but at least we can agree your menu is a little less slanty-eyed.” That’s followed up by an apology for accidentally sending what was meant as a private joke, which has the effect of making the mail seem more authentic.Edelman’s domain name, benedelman.org, is easily found on the Web, and it’s not difficult to send an email using any address you like. The Sichuan Garden website offers an email form that lets you do exactly that. One clue is that all of the legitimate emails Boston.com has posted from Edelman are marked as coming from “Ben Edelman,” whereas the racist email and subsequent apology were from “ben@benedelman.org.”Despite the retraction, Boston.com as of this moment is still all-in on the rest of its Edelman package. We’ll see what, if anything, comes next.",

   "text": "This post has been updated with additional reporting.The Islamic State has released a new video in which it brags that it recovered weapons and supplies that the U.S. military intended to deliver to Kurdish fighters, who are locked in a fight with the militants over control of the Syrian border town of Kobane.The SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist social media accounts, drew attention to the video Tuesday. At one point, it appears to show a masked militant raking his hands through a crate filled with hand grenades.A U.S. Central Command spokesman said he was looking into the reports. In a news release Monday, U.S. military officials acknowledged launching one airstrike near Kobane that they said destroyed “a U.S. airdrop of Kurdish supplies” to prevent “these supplies from falling into enemy hands.”“All other resupply bundles were successfully delivered,” the CENTCOM news release said, without specifying what was in the shipment.Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday afternoon that analysts were working to determine what happened. The Defense Department is aware that one bundle didn’t make it into the right hands, and is not sure whether the one that appears in the video is the same one CENTCOM already reported destroying.On Tuesday, the U.S. military announced another four airstrikes near Kobane, saying it hit Islamic State fighting positions, a building occupied by the militants, and “a large ISIL unit,” using one of the acronyms for the group. The U.S. has launched dozens of airstrikes around Kobane in the last week, as the militants besiege the town.The incident highlights the difficulty in making sure all airdrops are accurate, even with GPS-guided parachutes that the Air Force commonly uses. Airdrops of food and water to religious minorities trapped on mountain cliffs in northern Iraq in August hit the mark about 80 percent of the time, Pentagon officials said at the time.The United States began dropping weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and other equipment to fighters defending Kobane on Sunday night, in part because Turkey would not allow Kurdish fighters to cross its borders into Kobane to bolster the town’s defenses. Turkish officials said they changed their mind on Monday, but the deal is tentative and depends on whether separate Kurdish groups can resolve longterm differences to confront the Islamic State.Related on Checkpoint: Does this mysterious video show the Islamic State flying a fighter jet?U.S. airstrikes in Syria are now dwarfing those in Iraq, thanks to the fight for one townOperation against the Islamic State to be called Inherent ResolveIslamic State’s shootdown of an Iraqi helicopter amplifies fears of shoulder-fired missiles",

John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.U.S. military officials had acknowledged that they were trying to kill Godane in Monday’s air assault on a Shabab compound in southern Somalia. But they had been cautious about asserting the mission was successful, mindful of reports of other al-Qaeda leaders who had been killed in drone attacks, only to resurface later.The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Godane’s arrest. It identified him as a 37-year-old native of northern Somalia who, among other aliases, went by the names Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr and Ahmed Abdi Aw Mohamed.Monday’s drone strike was the most aggressive U.S. military operation in Somalia in nearly a year, and it came as the Obama administration was already grappling with security crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.Counterterrorism officials and analysts have described Godane as a particularly ruthless jihadi leader who eliminated several rivals within al-Shabab, either by killing them or forcing them to go underground.It was unclear who might succeed him as leader of the network. Although al-Shabab often posts comments from the group on social media and gives interviews with journalists in Somalia, it has been mum about whether he survived the airstrike.",

I'm not going to dignify the terrorists by posting the video here, you can look it up on your own if you'd like. A warning, extremely violent and difficult to watch. Wright's fellow journalist Ihan Tanir gave some background on the situation on Twitter.More from Noah Rothman:The American photojournalist James Wright Foley was working for Agence France Presse when he was captured crossing the Syria-Turkish border in 2012. The American war reporter had previously been held for six weeks by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya while covering that conflict. Some believed that his capture would be similarly short-lived. Tragically, that would not be the case.“On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” the FBI noted in November, 2012. “Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.”Swift justice is in order. Immediately. May his family find peace in this extremely difficult time.

The S1 produced by Samsung will combine multiple components including the processor, mobile DRAM, NAND flash, and other chips into one package.A report in November shared similar information, noting that Apple would be relying heavily on Samsung for iPhone 6 and Apple Watch components. Namely, Apple was said to be concerned about NAND flash, with its cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models said to be the source of crashing issues. Those issues, along with Samsung's competitive prices, were said to be the primary reasons in bringing Apple back to negotiations with the South Korean company.Apple is said to be targeting a March launch for the Apple Watch, as the company is said to be refining the device's \"Watch OS\" software and working on hardware components like the inductive charging mechanism.

IS-affiliated websites claimed over the weekend she was captured near locations where Kurdish and IS forces were engaged in battle, but Kurdish sources told the Jerusalem Post the reports of her capture were merely IS propaganda.Two messages have appeared on the Facebook social media website since Sunday night, indicating Rosenberg was not taken prisoner. Facebook user Oliver Bruno wrote \"Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause (sic) she has no internet access. ISIS's supporters launched a rumor on social media that she was captured in ‪#‎Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300 km. from Kobani.\"The message would imply Rosenberg left Israel to fight but was some 186 miles away from Kobane, a town on the Syria-Turkey border and the scene of two months of fighting.A later message from Bruno said the head of the YPG Kurdish forces in Kobane \"categorically refuted these allegations.\"Another message from Facebook user Emanuela Siyar Barzani, citing a \"qualified\" source, noted \"Everything is fine with Gill.\"On Saturday, an online form posted a message from a pro-IS contributor, claiming a \"female Zionist soldier\" was captured in Kobane by IS forces, the SITE Intelligence Group reported.

The whereabouts of the students, who disappeared after a confrontation with police in late September, have been the subject of mass protests in the state.Authorities have been conducting DNA tests on the 28 badly burned bodies found in the graves since discovering them earlier this month. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said tests were continuing on four additional graves uncovered last week.State governor Angel Aguirre said some of the bodies could have been earlier victims of criminal gangs, and some of them seemed to have been buried “months ago.”Murillo Karam, speaking at a news conference Tuesday, added that 14 additional police officers were arrested over the disappearances. So far, 50 people, mostly police, have been arrested for their roles in the incident, and prosecutors accuse police of colluding with a local gang known as Guerreros Unidos. The police chief and mayor of Iguala, the town where the confrontation between police and students occurred, have also been accused of ties with the gang. Both are currently in hiding.On Tuesday, the leader of Guerreros Unidos, Benjamin Mondragon, committed suicide by shooting himself when confronted by security forces in the neighboring state of Morelos. Federal authorities said it wasn’t clear whether Mondragon was involved with the student disappearances.Hundreds of protesters, many from the teachers’ college that the missing students had attended, took to the streets in Guerrero’s capital of Chilpancingo this week over the disappearances. The protests turned chaotic on Tuesday when demonstrators overtook state government buildings, ransacked offices and burned parts of the complex. On Tuesday, they took over bank branches and a local radio station and vowed to keep up the pressure on Guerrero’s government until the missing students were found.",

   "text": "Militants reportedly have three captured jets and witnesses cited as saying they have seen planes flying low over AleppoIslamic State (Isis) is takings its first steps towards building an air force by training pilots to fly captured fighter planes, according to a group monitoring the conflict in Syria.Isis is using lots of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and Jeeps taken from the Syrian and Iraqi armies but this is the first report that it has planes in the air.Isis, which took the US by surprise this year with its rapid territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq, has three Russian-built MiG jets, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which appears to have a good network of observers on the ground and has often proved reliable in the past.Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the British-based group, said Isis has trainers who had gained experience in the Iraqi air force under former president Saddam Hussein.Abdulrahman cited witnesses who had seen the planes flying low over Aleppo, in rebel-held northern Syria.If Isis was able to train pilots, they could mount 9/11-style suicide attacks on key installations in Damascus or Baghdad.Defence analysts said that while this is feasible, they were extremely sceptical. “There is a small chance but not a big chance,” said Afzal Ashraf, a former RAF captain, counter-terrorism specialist and consultant at the London-based Royal United Services Institute(Rusi).It was feasible to train pilots for small aircraft but it would be a struggle to do the same with an advanced fighter jet. Such jets would require frequent maintenance as well as a good navigation system and air traffic control, Ashraf said.Such planes could be easily picked off by US, UK, Turkish or even Syrian planes or air defences. The UK is flying reconnaissance and bombing missions only over Iraq while the US is engaged in both Iraq and Syria.In February last year, the SOHR reported the capture of the al-Jarrah military airport near Aleppo, which had been held by Assad’s forces. The MiG fighters were said to have been taken at the time.The monitoring group reported witnesses saying the planes flying low over Aleppo recently appeared to be MiG 21s or MiG 23s and had taken off from and returned to the nearby al-Jarrah base. It added that training courses are taking place at the base.The SOHR said it did not know whether the planes were armed with missiles.Isis has taken swathes of Sunni-dominated territory in Iraq and is on the outskirts of Baghdad.Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorist specialist at Rusi, said he had seen footage of captured planes and questioned their viability. “They were covered in bird shit,” he said.Pantucci said they would pose no problem for the sophisticated air defence capabilities of the US and its Nato ally Turkey, and even to a lesser extent those of Syria’s President Bashar-al-Assad.Ashraf said of the former Iraqi air force pilots reported to have joined Isis that it would be hard for them to keep up with the latest advances. “Flying is a very perishable skill,” he said.He predicted they were almost certain to crash. “You have to be able to fly and to take off and to navigate. If you do not know what you are doing, you are likely to stall it,” Ashraf said.",

We will provide more information when it is available.”President Obama was briefed on the video aboard Air Force One as he returned to his Martha’s Vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments, the White House said.“If true, the murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved,” British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter. His office said Wednesday he was cutting short a family vacation and returning to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria.In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.Philip Balboni, GlobalPost’s chief executive and co-founder, said in a statement: “On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family.”In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother appeared to accept that the video was authentic. “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.Sotloff, a freelancer who worked for several news organizations, disappeared in Syria in August 2013.In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012, according to a 2013 GlobalPost article. No one has claimed to be holding them.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its chest.The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.Julie Tate, Greg Miller and Dan Lamothe in Washington, Griff Witte in London and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.",

Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from \"terrorists\" who came \"from several countries\" and Africa. Mashable further confirms, three outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul. For now, it's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus; but it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine. As Mashable reports,Reports that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola swirled though Iraqi media sources on Wednesday. World Health Organization officials said they haven't confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance. ... \"We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,\" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications told Mashable. Feig added that WHO is in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if they need help investigating the cases, a task that could be a challenge, given the restrictions that would come with operating in ISIS-controlled territory. It's unclear if any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants' symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus. ... Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said the disease arrived in Mosul from \"terrorists\" who came \"from several countries\" and Africa. ... If the cases in Mosul turn out to be Ebola — a scenario that, at this point, seems highly unlikely — it would mark the first time the virus had been detected in an area controlled by ISIS, a group that doesn't embrace science and modern medicine. Over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul, according to Benjamin T.

Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are \"incorrect\" and \"unfounded.\"But, perhaps most concerning,In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. “The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”*  *  *",

   "text": "The very first nonsense I had to debunk in 2014 was a claim that on Jan. 4 of that year a planetary alignment would cause gravity to decrease, allowing you to float momentarily or fall more slowly if you jumped in the air at the right moment: “Zero G Day.” This exact same hoax has resurfaced this week in a couple of places, so I’ve decided to update the debunking to include some new links and repost it, hopefully to stem the tide of silliness at year’s end. It seems fitting that (hopefully) this is also the last debunking I’ll make in 2014. But who knows? There’s still a week left.Something you’ll never hear me say: “Well, now I’ve heard it all.”Long experience has taught me there is always a sillier claim. Always. And you’re hearing that from a guy who has debunked the ideas that the Maya calendar predicted the end of the world, that the “Supermoon” caused earthquakes, and that a magnetic pole flip of the Earth will cause superstorms (and another saying the Earth is already physically starting to flip over).So what’s sillier than these? Well, we now have the claim that early next year—on Jan. 4, 2015 at 09:47 PST to be exact—due to the combined gravity of Jupiter and Pluto, you will be able to jump in the air and float for just a couple of seconds (or at least fall more slowly, depending on different “sources”).It’s hard for me to overstate just how wrong this claim is. First off, this exact same hoax was pulled last year, in 2014, by a site called News Hound (now offline, apparently), and a lot of people fell for it. Here we are again, a year later, back at the same spot. This time the joke is being made by a “news” site called Daily Buzz Live (which didn’t even bother to change much of the wording of the original hoax). They even have a picture of a NASA tweet about the event:There’s only one problem: That picture is completely fake. NASA never tweeted it, and it was presumably made up wholesale for the article on Daily Buzz Live. Whoever did it was clever, adding the number of retweets and favorites, but it’s as fake as a $20 iPhone you can buy on the street in New York City.After all, the physics of “Zero G Day” is wrong, the claim about Pluto and Jupiter is wrong, and—and this part is the real killer—it’s based on a joke made by an astronomer nearly 40 years ago!Despite this, it’s spreading around Facebook (and Twitter) so much once again that I got a lot of people asking or telling me about it. That’s why I’m debunking this thing again.So to get started, here’s the claim:It has been revealed by the British astronomer Patrick Moore that, on the morning of January 4th 2014, an extraordinary astronomical event will occur. At exactly 9:47 am, the planet Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to the Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people weigh less. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Yeah, except this is all baloney. To be polite. OK, so why is this wrong?Pluto and Jupiter, Sitting in a Tree …First of all, the gravitational forces of the other planets in the solar system have essentially zero effect on you personally.And we’re done. Full stop.OK, fine, I’ll give some brief details. The planets are big objects with lots of gravity, but that only affects you if you’re close to them. Space, however, is big—that’s why we call it space—and planets are far away. This weakens their gravity on you hugely, reducing it to less than the impact of the flutter of a butterfly’s wing.If you want the math, then here you go: Even if you add all of the planets together, they pull on you with a force less than 2 percent of that of the Moon! The Daily Buzz Live article mentions tides, too, but that’s even worse: The combined tidal force from the planets is far less, like 0.005 percent of the Moon’s! Simply put, the planets are just too far away to have any real effect on you. By the way, the Moon orbits the Earth on an ellipse, so its own gravity fluctuates far more than the combined strength of the planets every two weeks.Note that you cannot float in the air every two weeks.And specifically, the gravity from Pluto is weakest of them all. Pluto is a teeny tiny ice ball, far smaller than even our Moon … and at its closest it’s flippin’ 4 billion kilometers (2.5 billion miles) from Earth. That’s a long way. A car on the road half a kilometer away has more gravitational pull on you than Pluto does.In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does. That's about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell ... so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.Location3It gets worse (amazingly). The article says Pluto will be “directly behind Jupiter” on Jan. 4, 2015. I checked: On that day they are on nearly opposite sides of the sky. They’re really far apart, about 145°. You couldn’t have picked a much worse date to claim Pluto was behind Jupiter.So the physics of the claim is ridiculous. But the origin of the claims makes it even funnier.Fool Me Once, Shame on YouThe article on Daily Buzz Live mentions that this claim came from Patrick Moore. He was a real astronomer in the U.K., an enormously popular radio and television science program presenter—he predated Carl Sagan and is still considered an icon of science in England.The wonderful thing about all this is: Moore actually did make this claim! However, as Snopes.com points out, it was an April Fools' Day joke. Moore made this claim in 1976 on his radio program. To my complete unsurprise, apparently some folks called in to say they did feel the effect! This is called “priming,” where you tell people in advance that they’ll feel something due to some cause, and they will, even if the cause never happened. It’s used by ghost hunters and ghost tour guides quite a bit, to spook people before they actually enter a “haunted house,” guaranteeing they’ll feel chills as they walk from room to room. I’ve seen this myself first hand: People can convince themselves of amazing things that never actually happened.Hope FloatsSo there you go: It’s a repeat of a silly claim based on a joke in the first place.I know a lot of people reading this right now are slapping their foreheads and wondering how people can be so stupid as to fall for this. I understand this reaction, but I don’t share it. Smart people fall for silly things all the time, and intelligence isn’t really the prime factor here.Skepticism is. In general, schools don’t teach people how to analyze a claim, how to tell if something makes sense on the surface of it, or how to go about looking into the claim. I knew right away to do the math, and to see if Pluto and Jupiter really were aligned as the article says. But all too often, people don’t think carefully (or at all) about these claims, and simply spread them through social media. All it takes is literally the click of a “Share” button. Pseudoscience thrives via this virulence, whereas truth must take a harder path.In fact, that’s why I bother debunking stuff like this. Sure, this is a silly claim, and probably harmless in practice. But not all of them are; I already mentioned the “Mayan Notpocalypse” from 2012, and I can tick off a dozen other doomsday or scary claims that spread due to a lack of skepticism. And of course there are real issues like global warming denial, anti-vaccination, and more, which live and breathe and spread due to a lack of skepticism in the public.In my original post about this in January 2014, I said, “This particular bit of fluff will dry up and float away in a day or two, but those others are here to stay for a long time.” I was wrong, and I should’ve known that something like this would resurface again in a year; it’s like the “Mars as big as the Moon” nonsense that comes back year after year.Still, my hope is that every time we take a moment to inject a bit of (polite) skepticism into people’s everyday lives, it makes the world a slightly better place to be.If enough of us do it often enough, we can change “slightly” to “magnificently.”",

   "text": "Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages - scattering the creatures and inciting panicMilitants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemies.Canisters packed with poisonous varieties of scorpion are being blasted into towns and villages, which explode on impact - scattering the scorpions and causing panic among the innocent local population.Although scorpion bombs sound like something out of a modern horror movie, the tactic is actually thousands of years old and was first used by Iraqis fighting against the Roman Empire.Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, told The Mirror that ISIS had improvised devices to launch the poisonous creatures in 2ft bombs.He said: 'Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.'Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.'Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he was advising security forces, said that the bombs are not causing casualties but had a profound 'psychological impact'.The bizarre biological weapon was used as far back as 198 AD, when Iraqis stuffed live scorpions into ceramic pots and hurled them at Roman armies marching on the fortress city of Hatra.The Parthian city was held under siege for 20 days by Emperor Septimius Severus before the Roman military were driven out by the 'live grenades'.Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have unveiled their latest terror tactic - bombs containing hundreds of live scorpions designed to spread fear among their enemiesAdrienne Mayor, a historian of ancient science and classical folklorist, researched the weapon in detail for her 2004 book Greek Fire, Poison Arrows & Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World.The live grenades were first used by Iraqis in the besieged city of Hatra in 198-199AD.Soldiers would pack ceramic pots full of live scorpions which they would then hurl at the Romans led by Emperor Septimius Severus.It is thought that they would first spit on the scorpions to slow them down so they could be handled - although it was still an incredibly risking tactic.The biological weapon has been credited with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city.She describes how soldiers would spit on the end of the scorpion to calm the creatures before they were packed into pots, which were flung at the besieging Romans.'It was the brute effectiveness of Hatra's defensive biological and chemical weapons that overcame Roman morale, manpower and siege machines,' she writes. 'The terror effect would be quite impressive.'Last week, the U.S. confirmed it had launched a further 20 airstrikes against ISIS targets, including raids near Sinjar, Qaim, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as inside Kobane.ISIS militants have been attacking the Iraqi town of Kobane since mid-September, when the terror group assaulted its southern suburbs in an attempt to seize control of the strategic border city.The terror group quickly encircled the city, raping and murdering its inhabitants, but Kurdish YPG fighters supported by U.S. airstrikes have since pushed ISIS back out of central Kobane.A temple in the ruins of the Parthian city of Hatra, where scorpion bombs were first used in 189/199AD",

Since then, the almost too-perfect clip has been featured everywhere from the L.A.

As he was walking out of the liquor store, Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver's seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos. \"I was like, 'Oh my God, it's him,\" says Kadalim, adding that he subscribed to Lin's YouTube channel. \"I couldn't believe it.\"A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin's car, and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas, the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera. Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video, Kadalim decided to stick around and watch.Of course, given how many of this year's viral videos were hoaxes, staged or otherwise bullshit, it should hardly be surprising that this one might be too. Unlike those videos, however, this one has six figures (purportedly to help Thomas \"get a fresh start\") in questionably controlled donations attached.When pressed, Lin denied any part of his video had been staged or scripted. \"There is is no way we're making this up,\" Lin told Vocativ. \"This is real.\"",

   "text": "The value of breaking into the top 100 ranking on the App Store - or higher, really - is fairly well-established (if not a fool-proof way to make a profit).The same is true whether you’re a developer in the UK or China. And while Apple has some fairly strongly worded guidelines about app store 'manipulation', that doesn’t stop people trying it.Well now that effort seems to have been summed up in a single photograph, which has recently gone viral in China:The photo appears to show a woman in front of a rack of about 100 iPhone 5Cs, downloading apps repeatedly from different accounts. It was published in local media, and resurfaced on Apple rumors site Cult of Mac and Tech In Asia.However, the photo is completely unsourced, low-quality and unverified — so while many have speculated this is evidence of ranking manipulation ‘farms’, that's not quite right. The presence of the iPhone 5C suggests it's a relatively recent picture, but whether or not that means ranking manipulation has any effect in the real world we just don't know.Also unclear is the veracity of another image going around which shows the prices being charged to break apps into the rankings list.That picture claims it will cost a developer the equivalent of £7,400 to get an app into the Top 10, and about six times as much to keep it there for a week.While app store rankings manipulation is clearly an issue in China - at least, there are companies willing to charge for the service, as evidenced by a simple search on local e-Commerce sites - what’s not clear is how much of an impact this would actually have on the App Store.For its part, Apple has taken a tough line on rankings cheats. Apple says in its guidelines for developers that any effort to cheat the system will be dealt with swiftly and severely:\"If you attempt to cheat the system (for example, by trying to trick the review process, steal data from users, copy another developer's work, or manipulate the ratings) your Apps will be removed from the store and you will be expelled from the developer program.\"\"Developers who attempt to manipulate or cheat the user reviews or chart ranking in the App Store with fake or paid reviews, or any other inappropriate methods will be removed from the iOS Developer Program\"",

It sounded good, but unfortunately as it turns out, it might not necessarily have been true, which we have to say is a bit unfortunate.This is according to the folks at iFixit who responded to the original Reddit post with their own findings. According to the original post, the user claims that his newer iPhone weighs 21 grams more than his wife’s model. iFixit on the other hand who compared a day one model to a newly purchased model only noticed a 0.8 gram difference.“I just went to the store and bought a brand-spanking-new iPhone 6 Plus, 128 GB, Space Gray, Verizon unit…It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit.” However as noted on the Apple website, there is a small note that reads, “Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.” 9to5Mac’s source also tells them that a difference in 1.5 grams between any two iPhone 6 Plus models is expected.Like we said this is a little unfortunate as we’re sure many users would have been pleased to learn that Apple could be reinforcing its iPhone 6 Plus models. However as Apple claimed back then, less than 10 users had officially come forward to complain about the reported bending, which means that it wasn’t as widespread as many would have thought it to be, but what say you? Are you a little disappointed by this?[Image Credit - iFixit]Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 6 plus.",

It also said that clashes in the area overnight had killed 10 insurgents, bringing the number of IS fighters killed to at least 39. At least 27 Kurdish fighters have died.Meanwhile the Islamic State group called on Muslims to kill citizens of all countries taking part in the US-led anti-jihadist coalition by any available means, in a statement posted online Monday.\"If you can kill a disbelieving American or European -- especially the spiteful and filthy French -- or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him,\" said Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the group's spokesman.\"Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military,\" he said in the message, which was released in multiple languages.Adnani's message -- which was released in an Arabic audio recording, together with transcripts in other languages including English -- gave instructions on how the killings could be carried out without military equipment.\"Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,\" the IS spokesman said. \"If you are unable to do so, then burn his home, car, or business. Or destroy his crops. If you are unable to do so, then spit in his face.\"Adnani praised militants in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, calling on them to \"cut the throats\" of those fighting for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\"O America, O allies of America, and O crusaders, know that the matter is more dangerous than you have imagined and greater than you have envisioned,\" he said.\"We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the (Islamic) State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders, not slaves.\"\"We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted.\"And he mocked the US air campaign, saying \"Are America and all its allies from amongst the crusaders and atheists unable to come down to the ground?\"Addressing Obama, Adnani said: \"You claimed... that America would not be drawn to a war on the ground. No, it will be drawn and dragged. It will come down to the ground and it will be led to its death, grave, and destruction.\"IS has seized at least 64 villages around Kobani since Tuesday, using heavy arms and thousands of fighters. It executed at least 11 civilians on Saturday, including at least two boys, the Observatory said.\"ISIL (another term for IS) are continuing to advance. Every place they pass through they kill, wound and kidnap people. Many people are missing and we believe they were kidnapped,” Welat Avar, a doctor, told Reuters by telephone from Kobani.A Kurdish politician from Turkey who visited Kobani on Saturday said IS' offensive is comparable to a genocide.“Rather than a war this is a genocide operation ... They are going into the villages and cutting off the heads of one or two people and showing them to the villagers,” Ibrahim Binici, a deputy from Turkey’s pro-Kurdish HDP party, told Reuters.Waiting for Obama's General Assembly speechThe head of the Syrian parliament, Mohammad al-Jihad, called on Sunday to the United States to cooperate with Damascus in the fight against IS rather than form an alliance with countries that support terrorism, referring to Saudi Arabia and other countries that support Syrian opposition groups seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.Meanwhile, the United States, which has carried out airstrikes against IS in Iraq, has said it is prepared to extend them into Syria.US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Sunday that other countries were willing to join Washington in launching air strikes in Syria against IS militants. “We will not do the air strikes alone,” she told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" “But we’re going to leave it to other nations to announce for themselves what their specific commitments to the coalition are going to be.”Power told ABC's \"This Week\" there was universal support for \"degrading and destroying\" Islamic state. \"I will make you a prediction,\" Power said. \"We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.\"Obama will give a speech at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State.",

   "text": "Relatives of the more than 200 girls taken by militant group Boko Haram in Chibok, northern Nigeria expressed hope yesterday that a ceasefire deal said to have been signed between the Nigerian government and the Islamist group will end their nightmare and bring their families home.However, restraint appeared to be the order of the day, with the details of any deal still hazy and no word yet from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. Wild celebrations might have been expected at the apparent end of an ordeal that has lasted more than six months but they were not in evidence, with many cautious about what might happen. But officials have made clear that the return of the girls is part of the deal.\"We will know the negotiations were successful when we see the girls physically. And then we will know it is true. And then we will celebrate,\" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok's local government, told the Associated Press.Another resident, community leader Pogu Bitrus, told the news agency that \"people rejoiced, but with caution\".Some reports on Friday night suggested the girls, taken from a school in Chibok back in April, could be released as early as tomorrow in neighbouring Chad – but Reuters reported yesterday, citing two senior government sources, that the Nigerian government would be looking to secure the release of the girls by Tuesday.Yesterday Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said the authorities are \"inching closer to the release of the Chibok girls\". He later told Reuters that \"discussions will continue in Chad next week, and on the basis of those discussions we'll have more details\" on the girls' release.The second source quoted by Reuters said that there might need to be further meetings in Nigeria or the Chadian capital N'Djamena to iron out the rest of the details for the deal. \"We have confidence in those we are negotiating with, but we are still doing it with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could... disown the deal,\" he reportedly said.During its 12-year existence – the past five have seen the group trying to create an Islamic state in the north of the country – Boko Haram has been split. Doubts have been raised by some analysts about Danladi Ahmadu, the self-proclaimed \"secretary general\" of Boko Haram who was named by President Goodluck Jonathan's principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, as the Boko Haram's representative in the talks. Ahmadu gave an interview to Voice of America in which he confirmed the ceasefire that was officially announced by Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria's military forces, on Friday.In the interview Ahmadu appeared to say that he had not even met Abubakar Shekau.This is not the first time a ceasefire has been called, hence the trepidation on the part of families in Chibok. In July 2013, when a government minister announced an agreement, Shekau quickly denied it using a video message – his preferred means of communication. He said that whoever the government negotiated with did not speak for him, and that he would never talk to infidels.Leaders of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which gained the backing of politicians and public figures worldwide – including the US First Lady, Michelle Obama – summed up the mood.\"We are really cautious because there have been many times that such optimism has been expressed but did not materialise,\" Obi Ezekwesili, a former education minister said in a TV interview on Saturday. \"But all the same, we are hopeful,\" she said, according to the AFP news agency.Quoted by the Leadership newspaper yesterday, the headteacher of the school from where the girls were taken, Asabe Kwambura, said she would be the \"happiest person in the world\" if the girls were to returnPresident Jonathan has faced criticism over his response to the abduction of the girls – and Boko Haram's continuing insurgency. He was set to attend a rally in Abuja yesterday where he was expected to officially announce his candidacy for presidential elections next year, leaving some to question the timing of the ceasefire announcement.Publically, the President has also always said he would not release Boko Haram prisoners, a central demand of the group – but there has been speculation about such a deal.Other than the girls, some of whom have escaped back to their families in the months since they were taken, many in the northern provinces where Boko Haram have killed thousands during their insurgency will be hoping the ceasefire holds. However, yesterday there were reports that suspected Boko Haram militants had killed several people in a number of attacks on Nigerian villages that occurred after the ceasefire announcement, security sources and witnesses told Reuters.",

   "text": "BANJA LUKA  – Primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day excursion, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it. He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children. Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births. “In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,” he said. Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old. The problem of adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent, but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking. Thus, on a website where girls seek advice from experts, gynecologists, peers, one of them wrote:”I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I’m only 14… But I am afraid I’ll be judged.” The page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11, writes “Dnevni Avaz”. Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations, but adds that this is something that, unfortunately, is in the trend. He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and child birth are highly risky. “It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life,” he said.",

   "text": "Is Kim Jong Un's sister running North Korea?That's the latest question on the minds of North Korea watchers amid a storm of rumors that have built up in the weeks since Kim's last public appearance on Sept. 3. Other rumors suggest he is being treated for gout and that he has been hospitalized due to a cheese allergy.With so little hard news leaking out of the Hermit Kingdom, it's impossible to confirm any of this — including the rumor that Kim's little sister, Kim Yo Jong, is the new show-runner. But there is evidence that she has upped her political profile over the past few years, and she may be one of the few people on the planet with direct access to North Korea's leader. Here's what we've been able to mine.The two were born to Ko Yong Hui, a mistress of former North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Un was the middle child of this relationship, second to an older brother, while Kim Yo Jong is the former supreme leader's youngest child.Image: RIA Novosti, Dmitry Astakhov, Presidential Press Service/Associated PressThe pair grew up in Ko Yong Hui's residence in Pyongyang as well as in Switzerland, where they both attended school for some time, and have a \"very good relationship,\" Michael Madden, who operates a blog called North Korea Leadership Watch, told Mashable. At one point, the two appeared in the same school recital.She may have started working for the Korean Workers Party, the political establishment of which Kim Jong Un is the leader, around 2008, when her dad still ran the country. She reportedly worked to clear the way for her older brother to succeed her father once he died, though that's about all we know about their relationship.Kim Yo Jong was born on Sept. 26, 1987. By the time she was eight she was off to Berne, Switzerland, to attend school near where her older brothers were doing the same.She came back to North Korea roughly four years later, but not much is known about her activities until 2008, when she began to participate in the country's politics.“She was one of the only ones that was distinctly interested in politics, in North Korean politics,\" Madden said. Her father, according to Madden, used to go around telling his friends about his daughter's sharp political mind.Kim Yo-Jong, Kim Jong Un's younger sister..thought to be now running DPRK. pic.twitter.com/qTw0VP0e2t— North Korea (@NorthKoreaNews1) October 7, 2014Like many things about Kim Yo Jong and North Korea in general, her role in politics isn't clear.She may have started working for her father or her aunt back in 2008 as a \"junior\" member of the party, according to NK Leadership Watch. When succession plans were finalized for her father's eventual passing, the powers that be reportedly gave her a significant part to play, possibly a position within her dad's personal secretariat or on the National Defense Commission.She became a member of her father's inner circle by 2011, and that carried over to her brother's inner circle when Kim Jong Un took the reins later that year.“She can get [Kim Jong Un] on the telephone, she can see him in person, that kind of thing,\" Madden said.NK Leadership Watch has written that Kim Yo Jong plans her brother's appearances, \"including his itineraries, schedule, logistical needs and security arrangements.\" This past March state media reportedly listed her as a senior official within the party — a first, according to the blog.It's not much to go on, but Madden said that reports of turmoil at the top in North Korea are probably exaggerated. This is less likely to be a coup — and more likely, he said, that Kim Yo Jong is relaying her brother's orders while he takes a break.But that doesn't mean the world should take their eyes off the little sister.“Kim Jong Un is not a micromanager,\" Madden said. \"It’s very possible she could be running a lot more things than we think.”Have something to add to this story?

   "text": "On Friday, the Nigerian military reportedly agreed to a truce with the militant group Boko Haram. According to the announcement, more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted this year will be freed. According to CNN, the details of the release are expected to be negotiated next week.In August, the militant group Boko Haram declared an \"Islamic state\" in northeastern Nigeria, a territory largely occupied by the fighters. Boko Haram is believed to be hiding the girls somewhere in this area.This week marked six months since the mass kidnapping took place. Here's what has happened since.On April 14, 276 Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, according to official figures. The mass abduction occurred at night, and it took days before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear. Shortly after the abductions, a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by Nigerian soldiers, but the remarks turned out to be wrong. Whether or not the Nigerian army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned: Its reputation in the rural north is bad, and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes. One recent video allegedly showed Nigerian soldiers slitting prisoners' throats, according to Amnesty International.In the weeks following the mass kidnapping, criticism of the Nigerian government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls. In May, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message claiming that the girls would \"remain slaves with us.\"Nearly 200 days have passed since the girls were abducted, and according to estimates, more than 200 schoolgirls are still being held by Boko Haram militants.Only a few dozen girls have managed to escape over the past months: The Times of London cited an example of four girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for three weeks through the jungle. Most of the escapes, however, took place shortly after the abductions, as this graph shows. As time passed, hope faded for many parents, and reports of escapes became less frequent. \"The longer they're there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down,\" Jennifer Cook, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Time magazine this week, before the reports emerged that Boko Haram was considering freeing them. There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity — some say 215, some say 219.The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in April. Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since.Boko Haram is predominantly active in the northeast of Nigeria, where the girls were kidnapped, but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country.The militants have conducted an increasing number of attacks over the past few months and are now believed to be active in an area which could be up to 500,000 square kilometers, or 193,000 square miles. Its core area spreads over as much as 250,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of the United Kingdom. However, Boko Haram is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active.Fatalities from non-criminal Nigerian violence — a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors — have risen rapidly since 2010, and Boko Haram attacks are the main driver behind this rise. The militant group has killed at least 5,100 Nigerians this year, according to estimates of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. This graph shows how fatalities caused by Boko Haram went up from around zero to more than 5,000 annually within only six years.Although the threat posed by Boko Haram had grown steadily, it took until the April abductions for the conflict to make international headlines. The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to Boko Haram on social media.Up until May 13, about 3.3 million tweets were posted, using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. According to the BBC, most people who used the hashtag lived in Nigeria (27 percent) and the United States (26 percent). Still, thousands of tweets are being posted each week in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the Nigerian schoolgirls.The social media campaign found prominent supporters: As of Oct. 17, more than 57,000 users had retweeted Michelle Obama's message: \"Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls.\"Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls. -mo pic.twitter.com/glDKDotJRt— The First Lady (@FLOTUS) May 7, 2014The Obama administration deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in May. In a letter, the White House said: \"These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area,\" and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls. Chad is east of Nigeria. Other countries, such as China, France and Britain, have also sent military assistance to the region.According to some reports, Boko Haram started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in May. The value of a girl, according to Boko Haram: $12. The Associated Press cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions. In a video message, Boko Haram leader Shekau had reportedly announced: \"I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.\"The hunt for Boko Haram leader Shekau had started well before the mass abductions of the girls. In 2013, the U.S. State Department added Shekau to its \"Rewards for Justice Program,\" offering up to $7 million for information that led to his capture. Those efforts have been unsuccessful. A video which was released this month showed Shekau alive and in freedom.Meanwhile, USAID — the international development agency of the United States — has devoted about $150 million to programs aimed at providing education to Nigerian children and teenagers.The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in Nigeria. Only 28 percent of primary-age children have ever attended school in Borno, the state in which the kidnappings took place.The low attendance rates in an area partially under the sphere of influence of Boko Haram does not seem to be a coincidence. Boko Haram's name can be translated as \"Western education is sin.\"",

   "text": "An American hostage in Yemen held by al-Qaeda has been freed, according to statements from the country’s defense ministry on Saturday, however his sister has received information of his death.The defense ministry said on its website that an operation by Yemen's armed forces early on Saturday freed photojournalist Luke Somers and led to the killing of 10 members of the militant group holding him, according to Reuters news agency. It said the operation took place in the Wadi Abdan Al Daqqar region of Shabwa Province in the southern part of the country. But his sister Lucy Somers told The Associated Press that she learned of her 33-year-old brother’s death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington, nor from security officials in Yemen's capital, Sanaa.Meanwhile another account suggests Somers was wounded during the operation. \"American soldiers carried away the hostage. He was wounded and we don't know if he is dead or alive,\" the Yemeni official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity.Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.Al-Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers, 33, and a local al-Qaeda commander threatening that Somers would meet his fate in three days if the United States doesn’t meet the group’s demands, which weren’t specified.In a video posted Saturday near London, Lucy Somers describes her older brother as a romantic who “always believes the best in people.” She ends with the plea: “Please let him live.”In a statement, Somers’ father, Michael, calls his son “a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people” and asks for his safe release.“When foreign nationals were advised to leave Yemen, Luke refused to go, saying he felt safe and at home there,” Lucy Somers said in her video. “He felt the Yemeni people would look after him.”“Photojournalism has been his way of highlighting the struggles of the Yemeni people,” she said.Michael Somers said his son “was confident that no one would harm him for his simplicity and honest friendship to all Yemenis around him.”Luke Somers “told all his friends and loved ones stories of Yemenis’ generosity, humility and devoted friendship,” his father said, adding, “Luke’s life in Yemen these past three and a half years should not have ended with a kidnapping but with a great reward. The fact that he chose to live in Yemen and not the United States shows where his sympathies lay. Please bring Luke back to us safe and sound.”Somers’ brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, offered a similar message in an earlier video.“My life is in danger,” Luke Somers said in the al-Qaiea footage, which appeared to mimic hostage videos released by al-Qaida’s rival, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. He asked for help.In a statement Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a raid last month had sought to rescue Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site.White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan also said President Barack Obama had authorized a rescue operation to free Somers and other hostages but “regrettably, Luke was not present.”[With agencies]",

However, Ibrahim said she is not al-Baghdadi’s wife, as Lebanese officials had claimed. Instead, she is the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dumani, an Iraqi terror suspect being held by authorities in the country, Ibrahim said.BuzzFeed News’ report from yesterday follows below.

AP Photo/Militant video, FileAlthough their identities have not officially been made public, Reuters is reporting that the woman in question is an Iraqi named Saja al-Dulaimi, citing a security official and a senior political source. She is one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail as part of a prisoner swap for 13 nuns held by al-Qaeda–linked Syrian militants in March.The al-Safir newspaper said that Baghdadi’s wife was currently being interrogated by Lebanon’s Defense Ministry, the BBC reported.There have been conflicting reports as to whether the child is Baghdadi’s daughter or son. The security official cited by Reuters said it is his daughter, and that DNA tests have been carried out to confirm she is Baghdadi’s child. However, the BBC is reporting that the child is his son.It is also unclear when the pair were detained by Lebanese authorities, with Reuters saying it occurred “in recent days,” while a source told AFP they were taken near Arsal 10 days ago.Speaking to CNN, terror expert and Director at the Asia Pacific Foundation Sajjan M. Cohel said, “It’s certainly a new dynamic because we’ve never seen anybody connected so close to al-Baghdadi being detained.”However, Cohel questioned what the pair were doing in Lebanon: “Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?”Very little is known about al-Baghdadi.

Many escaped in the first couple of days but 219 remain missing.More than 500 women and girls aged from infancy to 65 have been kidnapped by Boko Haram and held in militant camps since 2009, Human Rights Watch said this week, including 60 reportedly kidnapped from two towns in north-eastern Nigeria last week. Many have been targeted because they are Christians or attending school.Girls and women abducted by the Islamist group and later released have spoken of life in captivity that included forced marriage and labour, rape, torture, psychological abuse and coerced religious conversion.Shekau said in the latest video that all of the Chibok schoolgirls had become Muslims. “They have now memorised two chapters of the Qur’an,” he said.Speaking in Hausa, he said: “We have married them off. They are in their marital homes.”Families of the Chibok schoolgirls said they were shocked but not surprised at the marriage claims.Pogo Bitrus, the head of the Chibok Elders Forum, said: “We were sceptical about the talks to release our girls and we never took the ceasefire seriously because since the announcement, they have never stopped attacking communities. Therefore the information that our girls have been married off is not surprising to us.”Bitrus has four nieces among the hostages. “We are only hoping the government will step up whatever efforts it is making to quell the insurgency,” he said.Enoch Mark, a Christian pastor in Chibok whose daughter and niece are among the hostages, said the girls’ families were “lost for words”.“Since they were kidnapped we have no certainty about the situation they are in. We keep getting conflicting information,” he said. “We only keep hoping that they will be returned to us.”Daniel Bekele of Human Rights Watch said the Chibok kidnappings and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign had focused global attention on the vulnerability of girls in north-eastern Nigeria.“Now the Nigerian government and its allies need to step up their efforts to put an end to these brutal abductions and provide for the medical, psychological and social needs of the women and girls who have managed to escape,” he said.",

The prime suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old London rapper, who left his family’s $1 million home a year ago to fight with the Islamist fanatics and once posted a Twitter photo of himself holding a severed head, The Sunday Times reported.He is one of six children of Abdel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges in connection with Al Qaeda’s twin 1998 bombings at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, the son of an Egyptian militant who is facing terrorism charges, went from rapping to posing with guns as a fighter for ISIS.After spending years in and out of Egyptian prisons, subjected to torture, the elder Bary and his wife Ragaa were granted political asylum in Britain in 1993. He was arrested for the bombings in 1998 and was extradited to the United States in 2012 after a protracted legal battle.Ragaa’s story is told in the book, “Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Woman of the War on Terror.”The younger Bary rapped under the name L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn Matic, and his songs had been featured on the BBC’s Radio 1 Extra, media outlets reported.In one freestyle posted on his Facebook page, he raps about being addicted to alcohol and “the rock.”“I swear the day when they came and took my dad, I could have killed a couple too . . . Imagine back then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick . . . violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”In July 2013, he posted on Facebook, “The Unknown mixtape with my bro tabanacle will be the last music I’m ever releasing. I have left everything for the sake of Allah.”On Aug. 13, he tweeted a photo of himself in Ragga, Iraq, holding a severed head and the caption “Chilllin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” The Times of London reported. His Twitter account was suspended soon afterward.Bary also tweeted a threat in June: “The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels). Beheadings in your own backyard soon,” according to the Sunday Times.In March, The Daily Mail reported that Bary claimed on Twitter he and another British jihadist were kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of a rival terrorist group.ISIS hostages referred to him and several other militants with British accents as “the Beatles.”The black-masked man who beheaded Foley in a video posted to YouTube on Tuesday had a distinct British accent.Some 500 Brits have traveled to the Middle East to join the terrorist group, Westmacott said, calling it “a betrayal of all that we stand for.”Federal officials have estimated that at least 100 Americans could be fighting with Sunni extremists who have seized territory throughout western Syria and northwestern Iraq.U.S. lawmakers joined in sounding the alarm about the threat from the radicalized jihadists — especially the many foreign fighters with American and European passports who could easily travel to the West.“They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores,” Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on “Meet the Press.”He said the number of militants with Western documents is “much higher” than the estimate of 2,000 that has been reported.“They get new recruits every single day,” he said. “If that's a British citizen, we believe it was ... that individual goes back home and . . . buys one plane ticket, they’re in the United States,\" said Rogers. “We may or may not know who that individual is. That's what's so dangerous about this, and why we can't let them continue unabated.”Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the militants “present the greatest threat we’ve seen since 9/11.”“This has been festering for the last year and now it’s culminating with the killing and the beheading of an American journalist, which I think is a turning point,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”“The American people — it has sort of opened their eyes to what ISIS really is, the true character of ISIS, how savage they really are, and their intent to harm Americans.”The FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a bulletin to local law enforcement Friday saying there are no specific or credible threats to U.S. soil from the militant group in retaliation for intensified airstrikes in Iraq.With News Wire Services",

But other details warrant a healthy dose of skepticism, said Bill Cooke, head of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. [Nicaraguan Crater Possibly Caused by Meteorite (Video)]\"Something that produced a crater this big should have also produced an incredibly bright fireball in the night sky,\" Cooke said. \"And no one reports a fireball, even though it was near midnight under scattered clouds.\"Further, Managua is a big city, with lots of potential witnesses to such a night-sky sight. People saw a bright fireball the last time Cooke can recall a meteorite blasting out a crater on Earth, in September 2007 near the Peruvian village of Carancas — and that impact occurred in broad daylight.A meteorite strike would also likely leave blackened fragments of the impacting body behind as evidence, both Cooke and meteor expert Peter Jenniskens said.\"If this crater has anything to do with a meteoroid impact, I would expect meteorites to be found in and around the crater,\" Jenniskens, of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California, told Space.com via email.No such pieces have been reported, and none are visible in photos of the crater, Cooke said.\"So I'm kind of skeptical of a meteoritic origin for this crater,\" he said.If a space rock did indeed carve out the Nicaraguan crater, the meteorite was likely relatively small — about 3 feet (1 m) wide if made of iron, and somewhat larger if composed of rocky material, Cooke added.Some Nicaraguan officials have speculated that the purported meteorite may be a piece of the asteroid 2014 RC, which flew by Earth on Sunday (Sept. 7), the AP reported. But that is not the case, experts said.\"For those wondering, the event in Nicaragua (poss meteorite?) is unrelated to asteroid 2014 RC. Different timing, different directions,\" NASA officials wrote today (Sept. 8) via the @AsteroidWatchTwitter account, which is run by the space agency's Near-Earth Object Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.",

No potential replacements were named, though director Danny Boyle, himself an Oscar winner as well, is in Hollywood to meet with actors for the movie.\"Sources say Bale, after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw,\" the report said.Bale is the second high-profile actor to circle the project, only to ultimately exit.

   "text": "BALAD, Iraq — Dizzy, vomiting and struggling to breathe, 11 Iraqi police officers were rushed to a government hospital 50 miles north of the capital last month. The diagnosis: poisoning by chlorine gas. The perpetrators, according to the officers: Islamic State extremists.The chlorine attack appears to be the first confirmed use of chemical weapons by the Islamic State on the battlefield. An Iraqi Defense Ministry official corroborated it, and doctors said survivors’ symptoms were consistent with chlorine poisoning.It is one of three crude chlorine attacks that Iraqi forces say have occurred since the extremists seized vast tracts of Iraqi territory this summer, although details on the other two incidents remain sketchy. The reported assaults raise concerns that the militants are attempting to hone their chemical weapons capabilities as they push to seize more ground.The presence of a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant in territory seized by the Islamic State has compounded those fears, though officials and chemical weapons experts say the 2,500 degraded rockets filled with nerve agents that remain there are unlikely to be fit for use. Weapons inspectors sealed them off with concrete in a bunker more than 20 years ago.The Islamic State’s reported chlorine attacks appear to have been largely ineffectual. The attack on the police officers last month is the only one officially documented.Chlorine, a common component in industry, is sold legally, but its use as a weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was widely employed in trench warfare during World War I, including infamously at Ypres in Belgium, where German forces dispersed more than 160 tons of chlorine into the breeze, killing thousands of French and Allied soldiers.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said last month that chlorine gas has been used “systematically” as a weapon in villages in northern Syria. The U.S. government has blamed those attacks on the Syrian government. But it has been years since the chemical has been used in fighting in Iraq.It was 4:20 p.m. on Sept. 15 when the 11 police officers were rushed into the hospital emergency room in Balad. Some struggled to stand; tears streamed from their eyes.“They were panicked; we were panicked,” said Kasim Hatim, the hospital’s director. “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.”The men had been brought in from the front lines of the nearby town of Duluiyah. Tucked into a bend of the Tigris River, the town had been under heavy assault for days, according to the accounts of three survivors. Islamic State fighters had taken territory to the north, cutting the only direct land access to the river town, and had blown up the last bridge into the town.The police officers, all members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, which has turned against the Islamic State, were guarding a line in the town’s north. After an exchange of fire, they said, they were surprised to see Islamic State fighters retreating from their position about 150 yards away.Suddenly there was a boom in the area the extremists had just vacated, said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, one of the survivors. “It was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,” he said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. The men say it hung close to the ground, consistent with the properties of chlorine gas, which is heavier than air.“I felt suffocated,” Jabbouri recalled. “I was throwing up and couldn’t breathe.”Another officer, Ammer Jassim Mohammed, 31, who suffers from asthma, said he passed out within minutes.The men were taken to a small clinic in Duluiyah, before being transferred by boat to the larger hospital in Balad, where they were treated with oxygen and hydrocortisone, an anti-inflammatory medication, until the symptoms began to subside. They were all discharged the following morning.The four physicians who treated them said there was no question that chlorine gas was to blame.One physician on the team, Hassanain Mohammed, had treated similar cases before. In 2006 and 2007, al-Qaeda in Iraq, a group that later morphed into the Islamic State, carried out a string of chlorine bombings in the country.Mohammed was on duty at a Baghdad hospital one day during that period when dozens of victims were brought in after a bombing in Taji district, just north of the capital, in which insurgents had packed a truck with explosives and two one-ton chlorine tanks.There have been no confirmed accounts of the use of chlorine gas as a weapon in Iraq since then.An Iraqi Defense Ministry official confirmed this week that a bomb rigged with chlorine canisters was used in the Duluiyah attack.“They use it just to create terror,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide the information publicly. “But of course we are very concerned.”In a statement, the Defense Ministry confirmed that the Islamic State has used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” near water treatment plants where it has gained access to chlorine, as well as in roadside bomb attacks. It did not specify the locations of the attacks, but there are several water plants near Duluiyah on territory controlled by the Islamic State.The extremist group aims to dent “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular,” the statement said.It said that soldiers should be provided with gas masks as a precaution and that volunteers and civilians should place a dampened cloth over the nose and mouth to protect themselves during any attacks.The defense official said he did not have details of any incidents other than the Sept. 15 attack, while a U.S. official said he had no reports of the use of chlorine by the Islamic State.“We aren’t aware of any chlorine attacks against the [Iraqi security forces] but would refer you to the Iraqi government to see what they might have,” said Army Maj. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for Florida-based U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for U.S. security interests in the Middle East.Chlorine bombs are an easy-to-create but inexact weapon, experts say. All that is needed is a small explosive charge to rupture containers filled with the substance.“It’s difficult to deliver on target in combat situations,” said Jean Pascal Zanders, an independent researcher who specializes in chemical and biological weapons and disarmament. “Chlorine dissipates fast unless someone is able to concentrate it in a confined area.”Fighters in Duluiyah say it was not the only time chlorine has been used against them. Another attack this month caused minor injuries, and the fighters were treated locally, police officials said.Immediately after the September attack, the Balad hospital put in orders for thousands of doses of atropine, used to treat nerve-gas exposure, Hatim said. A thousand have been shipped across the river to Duluiyah.Soldiers who escaped an Islamic State rout of a besieged army base in Saqlawiyah, where hundreds of soldiers were killed last month, also said chlorine gas was used there — though reports of where and how the gas was delivered varied and could not be confirmed.While some officers said air-fired canisters fell short of the base, others, who claimed to have remained in the installation for a longer period, said they fell within its perimeter.“It was chaos,” said Capt. Ahmed Hussein. He said he believed that gas canisters were fired into the camp but pointed out that the situation was highly confused. “I saw an explosion and smelled the smell; it was like bleach,” he said. “I was far enough away, but others were affected and were left behind.”Ammar Toma, a member of parliament’s defense and security committee, said it had received photographs from officers of the projectiles used in the Saqlawiyah area.“We aren’t sure chlorine was used,” he said. “But we believe it was either chlorine or another chemical.”Mustafa Salim in Balad and Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.",

He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.“It could have come off that asteroid, because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,” he said.Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was “very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.”Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn’t see anything strange in the sky.“I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,” Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.The site of the crater is near Managua’s international airport and an air force base.

Some users report having spiritual experiences.The fungi are often considered poisonous and a fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps.The sale of fresh and prepared magic mushrooms containing psilocin or psilocybin has been illegal in Ireland since January 2006.",

   "text": "BEIRUT — Lebanon’s military has detained a wife and child of the leader of the Islamic State, security officials said Tuesday.The spouse of another senior Islamic State commander was also detained by the army, officials said. The women and child might be able to offer insights into the activities of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his inner circle. Or they could become bargaining chips for the release of hostages held by the militant group.A Lebanese intelligence official identified Baghdadi’s wife as Sagia Dulaimi and said she was detained last week with her 9-year-old daughter at the Madfoun checkpoint in northern Lebanon.Other media reports, including from the Associated Press, identified the child as a boy. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.Baghdadi’s wife and child were carrying false identity papers after crossing from Syria, said the official, who was involved in interrogating the detainees. He said they were Syrian nationals, but other security officials said they could be Iraqi.The pair were being held at a Defense Ministry compound on the outskirts of Beirut, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a lack of authority to discuss the issue on the record.The second woman is of Chechen origin, said a Lebanese military official. The official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to give her identity or the name of her husband.It was not immediately clear whether the woman was detained at the same time as the wife and child of Baghdadi, an Iraqi whose real name is Ibrahim al-Samarrai.It also remains uncertain why the detainees came to Lebanon, where the Islamic State, a radical al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIS or ISIL, is opposed by both the country’s Western-allied military and the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia.The military official said a number of family members of Islamic State militants had taken refuge in northern Lebanon, where there are pockets of support from groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, or al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria.The three detainees could be used to bargain for the release of hostages held by the Islamic State, which has kidnapped thousands of people — including Arabs, Turks, Kurds, Europeans and Americans — to extract ransoms or punish those it considers guilty of religious transgressions. The militants also have beheaded captives, including two American journalists as well as American and British aid workers — in response to airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition, the Islamic State has said.The intelligence official said Dulaimi was part of a prisoner swap this year between the Syrian government and rebels in Maaloula, a city in Syria. The government of Bashar al-Assad agreed to release 150 prisoners in exchange for Greek Orthodox nuns who are believed to have been held by militants with links to groups such as al-Qaeda.In August, militants sympathetic to the Islamic State attacked the northern Lebanese town of Arsal and captured more than 20 soldiers before withdrawing. They have since beheaded two of the soldiers, demanding that Lebanon release a number of jihadists it has jailed.The Lebanese daily As-Safir was first to report on the detentions of Baghdadi’s wife and child, whom it identified as a son. The paper added that the arrests were made in “coordination with foreign intelligence agencies.”After lightning advances in Iraq this year by the Islamic State, Baghdadi declared a caliphate on land under the group’s control, which extends from deep inside Iraq to northern Syria.It is unclear how many wives Baghdadi has, although Islamic law generally allows four.Meanwhile, at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed by gunmen in an ambush in a border area Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a security official. Details on the assailants were not immediately known, but there have been previous clashes near the Syrian border involving security forces and militant groups including Jabhat al-Nusra.Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.",

   "text": "Cuban dissidents and Cuban-American media are reporting that Havana is plagued with the most serious rumors in months that former dictator Fidel Castro has died, after the one-year anniversary of Castro’s last public appearance transpired without fanfare on Thursday.The rumors began to circulate almost immediately after President Barack Obama announced that the United States would yield major concessions to the Cuban government in exchange for the freedom of USAID worker Alan Gross, jailed for attempts to bring Internet services to Jewish Cubans. As Fox News Latino reports, Fidel Castro made no public comments on the matter, triggering a wave of rumors in Cuban dissident media. Castro has previously commented on a number of current events, including blaming the United States and the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, of creating the Islamic State terrorist group in September.One dissident blogger in particular, Yusnaby Pérez, exacerbated rumors by writing about them in a Spanish-language post titled “Has Fidel Died?“, in which he detailed changes in behavior from neighborhood communists who had previously been loud and fervent in their displays of support for the Castros, particularly on January 1, the anniversary of the Revolution:This January 1st, my neighbor Mercy did not hang her “VIVA LA REVOLUCIÓN” sign, as usual, at the entrance to her house. How strange! It is the first year since I can remember that neither Fidel nor my neighbor’s odious sign–with Soviet font–appears.Pérez tweeted that, almost immediately after publishing the blog post, the Cuban government shut down his entire page, at least within Cuba. His Twitter account appeared unscathed, however, where he posted images of Cubans wearing American flag leggings after the announcement of President Obama’s concessions to the Castros.Rumors strengthened this week, however, as the anniversary of Castro’s last appearance approached. News outlets in Miami, the de facto capital of the Cuban diaspora, reported this week that the Cuban government had called for a press conference today to follow up Castro’s year-long absence with an update, many speculating that they would announce Castro’s death. The Cuban Foreign Ministry denied that any such press conference was scheduled for today, however, or that they had any major news to break. Instead, they noted that there was no record of an email or text message sent out to convene reporters, as is customary.But dissidents continue to report strange incidents that give fuel to the rumor that, if not dead, Castro is close to death. Miami media professor Carlos Peñalosa reported that rumors had not been abated by the Cuban government message, and that “[Venezuelan President Nicolás] Maduro must be on his way to Havana”:Yusnaby Pérez also reports that there are “strong” rumors that Raúl Castro called the socialist Venezuelan president urgently to Havana, another alleged sign that Castro has died:Maduro had traveled to China to ask the Chinese government for financial aid, as the Venezuelan economy is collapsing under his socialist price controls and suffering due to the extremely low international prices of crude oil. And despite the rumors, Venezuelan state media reported that he landed in Iran today, with no apparent emergencies to attend to on the Western Hemisphere. Nonetheless, Venezuelan opposition media are reporting that his departure from China was indicative enough of a route back to Cuba.While there are no concrete answers to whether the Cuban government is hiding either the impending or already occurring death of the leader of the communist revolution, the Daily Mail has a theory: that Cuban dissident media has confused the former dictator with Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician who died this week.",

The State Department desperately wanted to find him and had put a $7 million bounty on his head.His death deals a major blow to the Somali terror network, the Pentagon said.Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Defense Department’s chief spokesman, said the drone and aircraft attack directly targeted the terrorists.Six people, including Godane, were killed. The other five victims have not been named.In the strike, missiles destroyed a suspected terrorist compound near the port city of Barawe, a stronghold of the group. The missiles hit Godane as he left a meeting of the group's top leaders.President Barack Obama said airstrike was highly calculated and well planned.“That deliberation allows us to do it right,” he said at a Friday press conference.The airstrike against Al Shabab is part of the U.S.’s larger anti-terrorism campaign.

   "text": "Nouakchott — The Tripoli airport siege led to the disappearance of several commercial planes. Now countries on both shores of the Mediterranean are worried about how the missing aircraft might be used by terrorists.Rival militias have fought for control of the airport since mid-July, inflicting civilian casualties and extensive damage. But one unusual consequence of the ongoing battle has nearly a dozen countries on edge.After eleven civilian airliners were hijacked during the fighting, \"5+5\" member states reportedly decided to add an element to their scheduled joint military exercise. This time, simulations will include intercepting civilian or military aircraft piloted by terrorists.The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday, (August 18th).\"Libya was finally excluded because of the deteriorating security situation\", Reporters.DZ quoted the Turkish agency as saying.The objective of the exercise is to counter potential threats, such as the kind of suicide attacks seen on September 11, 2001, Sahara Media reported Monday.Libya in recent months has become a hotbed for the most dangerous terrorists in the Sahel region. These include veteran jihadists who migrated to Libya after fighting in Syria.\"These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens,\" analyst Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries, he added.According to Moroccan reporter Youssef Lakhdar, \"Co-ordination must be at all levels and not only when an imminent danger is coming.\"If Maghreb countries had coalesced sooner, the security chaos in Libya might have been averted, he said.\"Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries but for all countries of the world,\" Lakhdar added.The issue of Maghreb security came up August 15th, when African leaders attended the 70th anniversary commemoration of the Allied invasion of southern France during World War II.Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was among the African leaders and WWII veterans invited to watch naval parades and air shows near Toulon.His participation comes within the framework of strengthening security, military and economic co-operation between Mauritania and France, noted journalist Mohammed Yacoub Ould Moustafa.\"Many sons of the colonies participated in World War II,\" he added.\"This is why the presence of the Mauritanian president for this celebration is in recognition of Mauritania's efforts, in addition to the security policies connecting France with the countries of the Sahel,\" he said.",

They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadis.The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the man hunt.

The two others were called \"George\" and \"Ringo\".>Share this story on FacebookThe two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trail on terrorism in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of the UK's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Foley.Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.It is believed he was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary who persuaded him to join the fight in Syria.",

   "text": "The identity of the couple behind the mega-successful DC Toys Collector Youtube channel has finally been uncovered. Reportedly the highest paid creators on Youtube, having raked in an estimated $5 million in 2014, DC Toys Collector is allegedly 29-year-old, Brazilian-born Daiane DeJesus, a former adult film actress known as Sandy Summers, and her husband, Messias Credido, according to the Daily Mail. DeJesus’s porn star past could explain why the mega-successful Youtuber has chosen to stay anonymous despite months-long digging from numerous media outlets covering her channel’s surprising popularity. With over 5.2 billion views to date and nearly 3.8 million subscribers, the channel is an unbridled Youtube success — the scrutiny attracted by revelations of her adult film star past may have been figured by a cautious DeJesus to potentially dampen her kid-friendly channel’s image, and ultimately, perhaps, its huge revenue stream. Former neighbors and a “close friend” are behind the revelation that the DeJesus and Credido are behind the DC Toys Collector channel. The neighbors say they only learned of DeJesus’s adult film star career, which she reportedly quit seven years ago, after they saw her participating in a photoshoot by her swimming pool. They then say they were able to confirm their suspicions after identifying her in several “graphic adult-only videos.” The videos uploaded to the DC Toys Collector channel all feature a pair of disembodied, feminine hands unpackaging new toys as a soft voice narrates. They are a part of the “unboxing” video trend, which, according to Google, saw a 57% increase in views from 2013 to 2014. “That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere,” said one of the neighbors after listening to a DC Toys Collector video. The neighbor added: “Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. “We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. “Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers’ website and it all clicked into place.” When asked if the couple were behind the DC Toys Collector channel, formerly the Disney Collector channel, the ex-wife of Credido, Maribel Barreto, said: “Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can’t say any more.” Credido has also been identified as the creator behind the successful BluCollector Youtube channel, whose videos are nearly identical to the DC Toys Collector channel’s videos, except that they focus on toys aimed at young boys. According to the Daily Mail, DeJesus and husband reside in Orlando, Florida, in a house located in an “upscale” gated community. The couple have an 18-month-old son and were married in December of 2013, according to records seen by the tabloid. The DC Toys Collector channel began uploading videos in July of 2011 and is currently the 168th most-subscribed channel on Youtube. New videos are uploaded to the channel daily.",

As much as our collective morbid curiosity kind of wants it to be true, scientists have come to lend some healthy perspective to the situation.spider-neckDid it really happen?Image: schankz/ShutterstockYesterday it was reported in The Age that an Australian man had experienced something rather strange and all kinds of horrifying during a trip to Bali. After feeling a “searing sensation” around his abdomen near his old appendix scar, Dylan Thomas from Bunbury in Western Australia says he found out that a spider had crawled into his body through his scar and had made its way right up to his sternum.\"It wasn't really a tickling sensation, obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling,\" he told Radio 6PR.After a day or two of taking antihistamines, Thomas was feeling worse, and took himself to the hospital. He says the doctors finally found the cause of his discomfort. \"Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last three days, managed to get it out luckily,\" he told his friends on Facebook, according to Aleisha Orr at The Age.It sounds pretty far-fetched, and Thomas could well be telling the truth as it was relayed to him at the hospital, but Lauren Davis from io9 spoke to some scientists to get some much-needed perspective.\"I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible,” arachnid expert Christopher Buddle from McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences told Davis. \"Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.\"The best explanation the scientists Davis spoke to could come up with was that the doctors in Bali pulled something out of Thomas’s body, but it was far more likely to be a tick or a mite. Just not a spider. \"I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature (there are no parasites amongst spiders),” Marie Herberstein, who is the Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in Australia, told Davis. But she was careful to not completely rule out the possibility. She mentions that mites are also eight-legged, so perhaps it was just a really bit mite?  Head to io9 to read the rest of Lauren Davis's research into this odd story. Other than that, all we can do now is wait for the specimen - which is reportedly sitting in a jar somewhere - to surface...",

   "text": "Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.",

   "text": "Two U.S. officials say they believe American journalist James Foley was the victim executed by ISIS militants as shown in a grisly video released Tuesday.Separately, Foley’s family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a webpage that was created to rally support for his release.In the statement, Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, said the journalist, quote, “gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.”One of the U.S. officials said President Barack Obama was expected to make a statement about the killing on Wednesday.The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the video by name.Foley, a 40-year-old freelance journalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing nearly two years ago in northern Syria while on assignment for Agence France-Press and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the hostage situation by name.Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck more than 70 Islamic State targets – including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It’s not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it’s likely that some were.The Internet video begins with scenes of President Barack Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes in Iraq. Then it switches to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, a black-clad Islamic State fighter by his side. Foley’s name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation in sight and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report last November, CPJ concluded that the missing journalists are either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group’s report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives’ release.The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida’s leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have killed soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying executions – including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including Americans businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.",

   "text": "Boko Haram thinks all the truce talk is hilarious. At least that is what it seems like judging from a video released Friday to Nigerian media that purported to show the terrorist group’s leader Abubakar Shekau laughing off claims that it had reached a ceasefire with the government and that the more than 200 girls the group kidnapped six months ago were close to being released. “A lie,” Shekau said. \"We married them off. They are in their marital homes,\" he said, chuckling, according to CNN. He then added that the girls converted to Islam and “have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.” In fact, the whole issue about the kidnapped girls has been “long forgotten,” he added.In the video, Shekau said he had no idea whom the supposed negotiator was who supposedly worked out a cease-fire deal with the government on behalf of the Islamist group. \"We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,\" he said of the negotiator. He also threatened to kill a captured German hostage, who is “always crying.” He added that the extremist group could “hack him or slaughter him or shoot him,” reports the Associated Press.Throughout the rambling speech, Shekau, who “bristled with theatrical rage,” talked about everything from the “Islamic State to obscure Nigerian politicians to a threat to ‘eat the heart of infidels,’ ” reports the Wall Street Journal. Yet more than what he said, the mere release of a video is bad news for President Goodluck Jonathan, whose administration had touted the cease-fire on the campaign trail. Jonathan is expected to win a second term in February.",

   "text": "By Sylvia WestallBEIRUT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.\"They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,\" Abdulrahman said.\"People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,\" he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.U.S. MILITARY KEEPING \"CLOSE EYE\"\"We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,\" U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.\"We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.\"General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.\"We don't have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don't have any information on that either,\" he told a Pentagon news briefing.Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.(Additional reporting by Oliver Holmes in Beirut and Phil Stewart and David Alexander in Washington; Editing by Gareth Jones)",

   "text": "According to a new report from 9to5Mac, a new MacBook Air is coming. The new computer is alleged to have a12-inch screen, but remain about the size of the 11-inch model via reduced bezels on all sides. Possibly even cooler than that is the computer is said to be an actual thing, not like the iPad Pro we keep hearing about. Sources inside Apple claim to have been hands-on with the new device, which is also lighter than existing MacBook Airs.Aside from sporting a larger screen and lighter design, there are several other interesting nuances, here. The new-look MacBook is sporting a single USB Type-C port, which sounds silly — but isn’t.The USB Type-C port can handle things you’ve been relying on other ports to do for years, like external monitors. the new USB standard is also capable of charging, so MagSafes might be dead.That also means no multiple USB ports, SD Card slot, Thunderbolt — and you won’t be able to natively charge and use an external monitor. The natural assumption here is that Apple will release some sort of hub alongside the new MacBook Air for those occasions when multitasking is necessary.profilel-r-copyThe trackpad is said to be a touch bigger than the existing MacBook Air models (and get rid of the click), but the keyboard has reportedly been minimized to accommodate the slimmer profile. That means smaller keys, closer together, even though the keyboard is said to go edge-to-edge.The report details the device as overall slimmer than the existing MacBook Air 11-inch (which sounds insane), but a touch taller to accommodate the larger 12-inch screen. Speaker grilles toward the top of the keyboard double as vents for the CPU, too.What news don’t we get, here? Retina. Sadly, nothing in the report suggest we’ll get a Retina MacBook Air with the refresh. Fans of the dense Apple screens won’t find favor there, but we’ll all still marvel at the thin profile, should this actually come to pass as reported.Source: 9to5Mac",

   "text": "THE ISLAMIC State murderer dubbed 'Jihadi John' has been named as Mohammed Emwazi from west London, according to reports.It is understood that he was known to British security services who chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.A close friend of Emwazi told the Washington Post: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.\"He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.\"Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi's name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: \"The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.\"There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.\"Kuwaiti-born Emwazi is believed to have been raised in a middle-class area of west London, at times attending a mosque in Greenwich.He is understood to have graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Westminster, after which he started to become radicalised.The Post claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.He is thought to have travelled to Syria in 2012, before joining IS (also known as Isis or Isil), according to the Post.According to the BBC's Dominic Casciani, Emwazi was a \"person of interest\" to British security services from at least 2011.He apparently featured in \"semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK\".He is thought to have been responsible for the brutal executions of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American aid worker Peter Kassig, British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.Each killing was publicised in a series of highly-produced video clips.The masked executioner appeared to speak with a British accent, prompting speculation about his identity.The killer gained his moniker after being nicknamed 'John' by a group of his hostages.He was apparently part of a terrorist cell described as 'the Beatles', with other members known as 'George', 'Paul' and 'Ringo'.Commander Richard Walton of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) said:\"We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.\"We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.\"A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: \"(The) Prime Minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL (Islamic State) to face justice for the appalling acts carried out.\"There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria.\"It is not appropriate for the Government to comment on any part of it while this continues.”",

   "text": "Our Retina MacBook Air rumour article brings together everything we know or can plausibly predict about Apple's next MacBook Air laptop: a laptop that we're pretty sure will come with a Retina display. We're also interested in rumours that Apple will be launching its next MacBook Air in a new size: one based on a 12in screen.We report on (and analyse for credibility) all the rumours about every aspect of the new MacBook Air with Retina display: its release date, so you'll know exactly when the new Retina MacBook Air will launch; the Retina MacBook Air's specs, features and design; its UK pricing and availability; and all the rest of the clues and hints circulating on the web that could help us work out what to expect, and when to expect it. Finally, we will show you any Retina MacBook Air images that surface online, together with concept and mockup illustrations produced by clever artists with an eye for prediction.We'll update this article whenever we hear of new information, clues and rumours about the next MacBook Air, so bookmark this page and check back here regularly for the latest information about the new MacBook Air with Retina display.UPDATED: The plot thickens! Apple website 9to5Mac has commissioned an artist to produce detailed images of the next MacBook Air, based (the site says) on information from sources who have used prototypes. More info in the MacBook Air redesign section.Read our MacBook Air reviews \\ Which Mac laptop? MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro comparative review \\ Best Mac 2014Plus, find out what's in store for next year: Apple rumours and predictions for 2015Retina MacBook Air release date rumours: When is the new MacBook Air coming out?The latest 'word on the street' (not our words) sounds to us like a bit of a long shot, but here goes. It's been suggested by a number of websites that Apple will launch its next range of MacBooks during the Christmas holidays.Aside from the obvious problem (which is that this would be an unbelievable nightmare for us poor souls in the media), this seems to be a case of a reasonable article by Boy Genius Report, written back in August, being rehashed and misinterpreted this month.For a start, BGR wrote that the next MacBook Air would be ready in time for the Christmas holidays, not launched during them (releasing during the holidays would be a truly bizarre move, denying the products access to the lucrative pre-Christmas shopping period). That nuance seems to have been lost in translation. And beyond this, the article was as we said written in August, at which point a pre-Christmas launch still seemed possible. Now we're pretty much certain that the Retina MacBook Air will have to wait until 2015.UPDATE, 7 Jan 2015: Sure enough, no MacBook Air appeared over Christmas. The very idea! The latest rumour suggests instead that a radically slimmed-down 12in MacBook Air will launch in mid-2015, perhaps making an appearance at WWDC 2015. See more details and images in the Design section, below.We've been awaiting the launch of a new MacBook Air for some time. Back in summer 2014 Apple made a few tweaks to the MacBook Air line up, but this was mainly to reduce prices; the processor bump was very slight. Read our reviews of the current MacBook Air range here: 11in 2014 MacBook Air review and MacBook Air 2014, 13in, review.What people are really waiting for is a new MacBook Air with Intel's (delayed) Broadwell processor, and a Retina display.The new MacBook Air line up is said to include a completely new 12-inch model which may replace the 11-inch version, giving customers the option of a slighly bigger screen, or it may replace the 13-inch model, where customers could instead opt for the comparitively priced 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.So when will this new MacBook Air arrive? Reports in mid June suggested that Apple would begin production of this 12-inch MacBook Air in the third quarter. According to a DigiTimes report, Quanta Computer was set to begin production of the new 12-inch MacBook Air in July. This may have started, if the new Intel chips arrived in time...They may have: Intel has issued a press release regarding the arrival of its new Core M chip that some believe could be used in the new MacBook Air. A number of manufacturers are already said to be using this new chip in their laptops and tablets, and some of these models will be available in October. According to Intel, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba are all using the Core M.If this new Intel chip is used by Apple, reports suggest that the new Retina MacBook Air will be available in time for Christmas.In an August report on Digitimes, the Taiwan-based site claimed that its sources in the Taiwanese supply chain said that the production of components for the new MacBook had begun and that it may launch before the end of this year, or next year.However, there are also reports that suggest the new Retina MacBook Air could be delayed until next year - it may not be using these Core M chips, relying instead on a different series of Intel Core i5 Broadwell processors (more on that below).One report even suggests a mid-2015 launch date, claiming that the date has already been pushed back on multiple occasions.Read our New Retina iMac release date rumoursNew Retina MacBook Air rumours : Redesign, new colours, thinner designOn 6 January 2015, 9to5Mac posted a series of images that it says show the next MacBook Air's radical new design.New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5macAdvertisementBear in mind that these are artist's renders rather than photos of the real thing (although we're sure you'll agree that they're extremely well done - the artist is Michael Steeber). 9to5mac commissioned the images based on information it acquired from sources within Apple \"who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer\".It isn't entirely clear how much of the design comes from the sources and how much from the artist's imagination, although many of the most major changes (to the keyboard layout, for instance) are obviously in the former category.Sure enough, the new design is for a laptop with a new screen size: 12 inches. Yet the slimming process in these designs is so extreme that the new 12in MacBook Air actually has a smaller body than the existing 11in MacBook Air. The screen is a little bigger, but everything around the screen has been shrunk.Here (according to the renders, at any rate) is how the new 12in MacBook Air (left) will compare to the current 11in MacBook Air (right):New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5macThis also partly illustrates the biggest bombshell in these leaks: the new design finds space for only one port on each side of the laptop. It has a USB port on the righthand edge (the new, smaller and reversible, Type-C USB) and a headphone socket, along with a couple of microphone holes, on the left. If this is right, the MacBook will have to be powered via the USB port - and sure enough, USB Type-C will be perfectly adequate for that purpose. It just means that you won't be able to use a USB hard drive, wired mouse (or wireless mouse dongle) or other USB accessory while the MacBook is plugged in.Macworld contributor Kirk McElhearn is one of the sceptics who have pointed out the numerous inconveniences this would impose, and it's possible - likely, we would say - that the eventual layout will be less extreme. We think the MagSafe power connection is likely to survive. As we mentioned briefly, the keyboard is also designed differently. The power button now sits next to the Esc key at the top-left corner of the keyboard, and the keys have in general been shrunk down and squeezed together. The trackpad, on the other hand, has been expanded and now comes closer to the keys.New 12in MacBook Air design mockups by 9to5macAdvertisementOf course, 9to5mac's images aren't the first apparent leak about the next MacBook Air's design.Jack Marsh, a 16-year-old blogger who appears to have a source with plausible information about the new MacBook Air, seems to have become the the go-to blogger for all MacBook Air rumours. There have certainly been other young bloggers who have gained insight into unannounced Apple products, but as yet we can't be sure the claims are legitimate.Marsh has a rumour about the MacBook Air to add to an earlier rumour that suggested the new model would come in gold, silver and space grey finishes (more on that below). Now he claims his source has told him that the new design is so thin Apple has had to switch to a new reversible USB Type C connector which is significantly smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm).Apparently the MagSafe port is also getting a redesign for the same reason: the laptop chassis is too thin to accomodate the current MagSafe charger. Indeed the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way, although Marsh's source wasn't clear on whether this had been finalised yet.The MacBook Air is also said to feature thin bezels with a keyboard that stretches to the edge of the laptop. Marsh also claims his source told him: \"The display bezels are noticeably thinner - quite similar to the current MacBook Pro Retina lineup.\"Marsh's earlier report claimed that the new MacBook Air will come in iPhone-like space grey and gold finishes, as well as the usual aluminium.MacRumors lent some credibility to this inisial report, claiming that they are aware that \"Apple has at least considered launching the 12in notebook with several different 'special edition' colour options\". And it wouldn't be the first time Apple has introduced a range of colour choices on their Mac laptops.AdvertisementNew Retina MacBook Air rumours: 12-inch screenMany of the new MacBook Air rumours suggest this model will feature a 12in screen.Some sources point to evidence that Apple is working with 12in screens, but there have been claims that Quanta Computer will be building a rumoured 12-inch iPad later this year and it could be the iPad Pro that is being referred to here.According to a DigiTimes report in June, sources claim Apple wishes to introduce a smaller MacBook Air to make clearer the distinction between the 11-inch MacBook Air and the iPad Air with its 9.7-inch screen.Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple is working on a new version of the MacBook Air - one with a 11.88in screen. Other rumours place the screen size at 12in (which probably matches Matte's expectations).In his blog Matte seems to be suggesting that there may only be one MacBook Air - this new 12-inch model, with the 13-inch model being phased out in favour of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.The smaller 12in model could still accommodate a reasonably sized screen and keyboard if it had a smaller bezel.New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Fanless designThe new MacBook Air is also said to be even thinner than the existing MacBook Air. This is based on the theory that it will use Intel's new Intel Core M processor, a chip that doesn't need fans. By using this processor it is claimed that Apple could make the laptop 9mm thin. The MacBook Air is currently 0.3-1.7cm thick so it could be almost 1cm thinner at its thickest point.Apparently the fan assembly is the reason why the MacBook Air is thicker at one end than the other. Removing the fan assembly would enable Apple to make the laptop thinner than ever, according to reports.Presumably there will be some sort of cooling system built in, but that may not be necessary. The new Intel processors are said to be efficient enough to make the removal of the fan feasible - indeed there are already laptops on the market that do not feature a fan.Even the Core M may still require cooling in a 12in laptop, though. The new Broadwell processor should enable a fanless design for the smaller (up to 11.6in) laptop or mobile device, notes Motley Fool, based on what Intel said at its developer forum in 2013.It has been suggested that the MacBook Air could also offer thermal scaling and thermal management.Another advantage of a fanless design would be quiet operation. There would also be no moving parts (making it less likely to break), and it could also offer higher battery capacity because the remaining space could be used to house a bigger battery.(We can't help but worry that history could repeat itself if the MacBook Air is fan free - Steve Jobs famously refused to include a fan in the Apple III, leading to hardware failure.)New Retina MacBook Air rumours: USB Type CIf Marsh's source (above) is correct the new MacBook Air may offer USB Type C support, which is smaller than USB 3 (it's 8.4x2.6mm). USB Type C is able to support 10Gbps data transfers, which is twice as fast as USB 3, but still slower than Thunderbolt 2 (although the same as the older Thunderbolt 1).It will also support for up to 100 watts of power, which is apparently enough to power 4K displays, as Apple's Thunderbolt cable does currently. The only problem is that USB Type C isn't backwards-compatible.New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Inductive chargingMarsh's source also claims that the MagSafe port may get a redesign and that the MacBook Air may charge in an entirely new way. Perhaps the new MacBook Air will use inductive charging like the Apple Watch does.AdvertisementNew Retina MacBook Air rumours: Trackpad changesAccording to a report on Chinese site Weiphone earlier this year, the new MacBook Air will be thinner and lighter, a feat it will achieve by removing the fan and the clicking mechanism in the trackpad.The new 12in model will drop the trackpad and introduce \"force and optical sensors\" and new touch gestures, according to this report from BEN Latest News.New Retina MacBook Air rumours: Retina displayWill the next MacBook Air feature a Retina display? That's one of the strongest and most persistent rumours, and it's certainly possible.Apple may opt to keep prices down (and battery life up) by keeping the screen non-Retina; but we don't think so. According to our own reviews of the MacBook Air, the MacBook Air is currently let down by its display, which has a lower resolution than the competition.Canalys analyst Daniel Matte has written a blog claiming that Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year. He expects that we will see a 11.88-inch model with a resolution of 2,732x1,536 pixels, the same 264ppi that the iPad Air offers.He explains the significance of Apple using the same display technology for the MacBook Air and iPad Air, stating: \"It turns out that an ~11.88\" Retina MacBook Air with a 2732 x 1536 resolution happens to have the exact same pixel density as the 9.7\" 2048 x 1536 Retina iPads: ~264 PPI. It would make sense for Apple to take advantage of the same display technology it has been utilizing for the 9.7\" iPads by cutting their panels to this larger size.\"Rumours also claim that the new MacBook Air Retina display could have a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440 for a rumoured 12in display (discussed below). That's 226 pixels per inch, compared to 227 pixels per inch for the 13in MacBook Pro (which offers 2,560-by-1,600 resolution). This adds up to a 16:10 aspect ratio like that found on the 13in MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, rather than the 16:9 aspect ratio currently offered by the 11in MacBook Air.The current 11.6-inch MacBook Air offers a 1366 x 768 pixel display.The rumours of a MacBook Air with Retina display have been long running. Back in February 2013, rumours suggested that Apple was planning to launch a revamped MacBook Air with a Retina display in the third-quarter of 2013. A separate report in March 2013 also claimed that Apple would introduce a Retina display to the MacBook Air in 2013. Since this didn't happen in 2013, it is perhaps likely for 2014. Apple does appear to be moving the whole of its range to Retina display. The company updated the Retina versions of its MacBook Pro in 2013, and also introduced a Retina iPad mini in October 2013. Wondering what the Retina display fuss is all about? Read: What's a Retina display, and what's a Retina HD display?Apple may use the IGZO display technology for the new display, offering improved power efficiency. The reason for the supposition is that Apple was recruiting for a engineers with experience in LED backlighting and LCD displays, in February, according to CultofMac. In an LCD display the bunches of pixels with wires running behind to connect them. The backlight has to shine though this mesh of wires to light up the pixels. In an IGZO display more light is able to shine though this mesh of wires, so the power requirements are lower, and battery life can be preserved. As a result we could see even longer battery life than the 12 hours currently on offer from the 13in MacBook Air.AdvertisementRumours about a Retina MacBook Air with a smaller display have been circulating for some time. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested back in October 2013 that Apple will launch a 12-inch MacBook Air in 2014. Kuo suggested that this new MacBook Air would have an entirely new design.Then back in January 2014, Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang predicted that a 12in MacBook/iPad hybrid would launch in the autumn of 2014. It is possible that the rumoured Retina display MacBook Air could be this Mac.Canalys analyst Daniel Matte also believes Apple will add a Retina display to the MacBook Air this year.New Retina MacBook Air rumours: ProcessorIntel has announced the new Intel Core M chip. Some expect that this processor may be used by Apple inside the new MacBook Air. As mentioned above, because this chip doesn't need fans, the new MacBook Air could be less than a centimeter thick at its thickest point. Since it uses the 14nm processor, the processor itself it is tiny.The Core M processor should also enable the new MacBook to be more power-efficient with better battery life. Intel claims it's the most energy-efficient chip yet.The Core M also offers excellent graphics processing power, according to Intel. Intel says it will offer seven times the graphics power of four-year-old machines, and double the graphical and three times the web performance of the current range of high-end tablets.However, Intel has not confirmed that Apple will use the new processor. (In the press release regarding the new chip, Intel mentions Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba as potentially using the Core M. Some of these models will be available in October, according to Intel.)The Core M is designed for small laptops, large tablets and 2-in-1 devices, and Intel is positioning the chips as being for use in laptops of 13.3in, tablets above 10in and dual devices. Apple would traditionally use the Core i5 chips in its MacBook, so it is possible that these processors will never appear in a MacBook Air which may instead use the new U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.Redmond Pie reports that performance with the Core M hasn't been particularly impressive; it was featured in the Lenovo Yogo 3 Pro, which didn't exactly set the world alight: benchmark speed tests and overall reviews rated the device quite poorly. It's therefore been suggested that Apple may give the Core M a miss and go instead for an i5 or i7 chip.(On the other hand, some analysts have argued that Lenovo's implementation of the Core M, rather than the innate qualities of the Core M itself, was to blame for the sub-standard performance, and that Apple's engineers would be able to coax solid performance from a Core M-equipped MacBook Air. We shall see.)Whichever Broadwell processor Apple does use, it should make the Retina display MacBook Air possible. Broadwell is said to consume 30 percent less power than its predecessor Haswell, and that should be good news for battery life on the portable Macs, especially those with power hungry screens.Other features of the Broadwell chip are that it is low power and offers integration with WiDi, 4G WWAN and WiGig networks.AdvertisementNew Retina MacBook Air rumours: May not use Intel chipsThis rumour has been floating around for some time. It is possible that Apple will ditch the Intel processor in its range of laptop in favour of its own home-made A-series chips, like those found in the iPad and iPhone.  Some have even speculated that the new MacBook Air could mark some sort of crossover between the iPad and the MacBook, perhaps an iPad Pro.However, rumours that Apple will move from Intel to ARM chips seem unlikely, based on this explaination from Cult of Mac.New Retina MacBook Air rumours: UK priceWith the price of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display being so close we had expected that Apple would reduce the price of the entry-level MacBook even further. It's currently £749 for the 11in model, which is £100 less than in 2013. This compares to the MacBook Pro Retina starting price of £999. However, the fact that the top-of the range iPhone 6 Plus costs more than the entry level MacBook Air (£789) makes us think that the MacBook Air price is more likely to increase.It may be that the 13-inch MacBook Air is discontinued, as that model is similar in price to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina, but not equal in specs. This would leave the cheaper 12-inch MacBook Air models with, potentially, an entry-level price of £800.When it first launched in October 2012, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display started at £1,449. This was reduced to £1,249 a few months later when the range received a processor upgrade. Now, with the April 2014 update to the MacBook Air, the entry-level price of the 13-inch model is a much more compelling £999 which makes the difference between the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display and the 13-inch MacBook Air £250 rather than £150.In his predictions last year, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the price of this new 12-inch MacBook Air model could be lower than the current line up of Mac laptops.Read: Which 13-inch MacBook should I buy?Didn't Apple already introduce the 2014 MacBook Air?Apple unveiled the latest update to the MacBook Air on 29 April 2014.  Quietly updating its MacBook Air line-up with improved Haswell processors from Intel. You can read our review of the 2014 11in MacBook Air and the review of the 13in MacBook Air here.Aside from the small processor boost and a tiny battery life tweak, the main change for the new MacBook Air models was the price. Each model is now under £1,000, with prices starting at £749, £100 less than the previous models. This helps keep the MacBook Air an attractive option for customers, as the previous price was not much different to the price of the new MacBook Pro with Retina display.The range update came as some surprise as the Retina display for the MacBook Air rumour was already in circulation. Prior to the MacBook Air update in April, there were suggestions that the new MacBook Air with Retina display could launch at WWDC, but this was obviously not the case.Read our 5 reasons to buy a MacBook Air and 5 reasons NOT to buy a MacBook Air.Apple has updated its MacBook Air and Retina MacBook Pros for 2014, read more here:2014 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro review2014 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro review11in 2014 MacBook Air reviewMacBook Air review (13in, 2013)Why is the Retina MacBook Air delayed?If there is a delay, the key reason may be the availability of Intel processors, rather than the production of the new design.Intel's newest generation of chips - the successor to the Haswell chips currently in the MacBook Air - called Broadwell has been plagued by delays. However, in a conference call about Intel's second-quarter results on 15 July, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich confirmed Intel’s hardware partners will have Broadwell systems on store shelves in the run up to Christmas. He said: \"We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to work with our partners and we’re on schedule to have product on shelf in the holiday.\"As we mention above, some of these new chips are now shipping, however, anyone awaiting the new Retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac mini should note that there are various Broadwell chips being developed by Intel, and the chips that Intel confirmed are shipping now are the M variety, destined for fanless two-in-ones. The new MacBook Air may use the U Broadwell processor, which may not ship until 2015.We are sure that Apple is pretty frustrated with Intel.Shipment of Skylake – the successor to Broadwell which will offer even more power than that chip - is also delayed.New Retina MacBook Air release date: Will the MacBook Air be an iPad Pro?There are also rumours that Apple could launch a 12in iPad, but this might not arrive until 2015, or the rumours could relate to the 12in MacBook.There are also rumours that the new MacBook Air merge with the iPad to create the iPad Pro. You can read more about the iPad Pro rumours here.We think that a MacBook Air that offered a dual boot system for iOS 7 and Mac OS X would be very interesting, however, Tim Cook last year ruled out any kind of convergence suggesting that a Toaster Refrigerator wouldn't work.Will the old non-Retina MacBook Air remain?If Apple launches a 12in MacBook Air, will it discontinue the existing models? It's possible that if Apple launches a 12in Retina MacBook Air model it will discontinue both, or either of the existing models. Equally, Apple could maintain one of the existing models as an entry-level model. It seems more likely that it would keep the 11in model on at an even lower price, rather than keep on the bigger 13in model.One reason why Apple may keep a lower-priced MacBook Air on is the fact that Apple has just introduced a new entry-level iMac and already the MacBook Air looks superior to that, despite costing less. If Apple wants a low end option, it would appear unlekely that the Retina MacBook Air would be it.Read our review of the new £899 iMac and see how it compares to the MacBook Air.The new MacBook Air will be solar-poweredOk, so this is a bit of an out-there rumour, but it really is possible that Apple will one day release a new MacBook Air with a solar powered display.In January 2013, Apple was granted a patent that described a method for harnessing sunlight to illuminate a MacBook's display. This patent is actually the seventh solar-related patent Apple has gained in the past two years.New Retina MacBook Air leaked imagesAt present, there are no new MacBook Air leaked images to share with you, but we will update this story as soon as one surfaces on the web.We have seen a few concept images, however...Perhaps inspired by the Mac Pro, or the Space Grey iPhone 5s, there are calls for a black version of the MacBook Air.

   "text": "Jeny Chang for BuzzFeed / Via Drug Policy Alliance dataNEW YORK CITY — The New York Police Department will no longer arrest people for low-level marijuana possession, according to people with knowledge of the city’s drug strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity.The NYPD will issue violation summonses to people caught with marijuana — instead of putting them in handcuffs and taking them to a precinct. The summonses will require people to appear in court at a later date and pay a fine.Few details on the new policy were immediately available, but an official with one of the city’s five district attorneys offices confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Monday that the change “is happening.” The official added that “burning marijuana” would still be cause for arrest, but that having the drug in a public place would not.The NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but are expected to officially announce the new policy at a news conference on Monday.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance​ ​said​ Monday​ he supported the change two years ago and still does. “This policy – by diverting thousands of cases from criminal court – will also keep low-level offenders, particularly teens, from an arrest and all its attendant consequences, including a night or more in jail,” he said.The new policy, which was first reported by the New York Times, would bring about a sea change in the way the city is policed. Misdemeanor-level marijuana possession accounts for a large percentage of the city’s arrests, a vast majority of which happen to young black or Latino men living in poor neighborhoods.Some public defenders praised the policy.“This is a huge improvement,” Lisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, told BuzzFeed News. “Summonses don’t get you fingerprinted. This will be better for people who are vulnerable to collateral consequences, like immigrants.”Still, Schreibersdorf cautioned that the policy will not fulfill its goal unless the NYPD relaxes its identification requirements for summonses. Immigrants and teenagers often do not carry valid identification, she said, which often means that they cannot be processed for a summons. She added that the policy does not address the root cause of the problem — namely, that police officers in New York routinely stop people without probable cause.“Having summonses is an improvement for people who are already being stopped, but that doesn’t mean they should be stopped in the first place,” she said. “The problem, from my perspective, is that stopping people without cause is unconstitutional.”Advocates also warned that the new policy could result in an increased number of arrest warrants, which are issued to people who fail to show to court for a summons. As the New York Times reported, up to a quarter of people issued summons fail to appear for their court appointments. As a consequence, there are currently 1.2 million open bench warrants in New York City — about one per every eight residents.Possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana has not been a crime in New York State since 1977. The NYPD made 59,000 arrests for misdemeanor possession in 2010.Under current law, the only way to get arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for having less than 25 grams of marijuana is to display it “in public view.” The legal definition of that term, however, is ambiguous. “Public view” can mean smoking pot in a public place, but it can also mean that a police officer stopped you, frisked you, and pulled a small bag of marijuana from your pocket.When the bag leaves your pocket, it has technically entered public view, and the officer can legally arrest you and charge you with a misdemeanor — even though you had less than the decriminalized amount. This broad interpretation of “public view” helped low-level marijuana possession become one of the NYPD’s most commonly used arrest charges during stop-and-frisks.The correlation between marijuana arrests and stop-and-frisk became apparent after 2011, when a U.S. District Court declared the policing tactic an unconstitutional form of racial profiling. By 2013, the NYPD was making only 28,000 marijuana possession arrests — still a large number, but 47% less than in 2010.A recent study by the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance found that upwards of 86% of all low-level marijuana arrests made in 2014 affected black people or Latinos — even though national studies have shown that white people are just as likely to smoke marijuana regularly, and slightly more likely to have tried it.The report also found that the geography of the arrests is highly segregated, with dominantly white neighborhoods seeing fewer arrests than neighborhoods of color with similar per-capita incomes.These stark race and class disparities in drug law enforcement became a sore point for Mayor de Blasio, who as a candidate promised to end discriminatory policing. They also drove Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, to announce in July that his office would no longer prosecute low-level marijuana possession, opting instead to dismiss most of such cases.Still, the NYPD defended the high number of arrests, with Willam Bratton, de Blasio’s police commissioner, saying that Thompson’s decision would not affect the NYPD’s approach to marijuana possession. The policy to be announced on Monday will mark the first time the current administration will take concerted action to address the disparities in marijuana arrests.In an interview with the New York Times, Thompson said he was worried that the new policy could harm those it was intended to help by removing prosecutors from the picture. This is because a prosecutor can opt to dismiss a misdemeanor, but cannot do the same for a violation.But as new report by the Vera Institute shows, prosecutorial review can cut both ways. The Institute analyzed data provided by the Manhattan District Attorney and found that black people and Latinos were “much more likely to receive a sentence offer including a jail of prison term” than white defendants in similar circumstances.In the case of misdemeanor marijuana possession, the Vera report found, black people arraigned in Manhattan were 19% more likely to receive jail or prison time than people from all other ethnicities. By contrast, defendants arrested in Brooklyn could expect their cases to be dismissed. The new policy is expected to standardize procedures across the city.More details on the new policy are expected soon. De Blasio and Bratton are scheduled to make an announcement together Monday at 3 p.m.This is a developing story. Check back for updates and follow BuzzFeed News on Twitter.",

   "text": "ESPN continues to try to thread the needle between holding the NFL to account for its handling of various domestic abuse scandals and maintaining its $15 billion broadcasting deal with the NFL that keeps everyone involved in the manner to which they’ve grown accustomed. This self-contradiction was encapsulated in the suspension of Bill Simmons for opining on what ESPN’s own reporting had concluded about the NFL.In that spirit, ESPN will feature Monday night a Deep Meaningful on domestic violence (not the network’s first). But per Esquire’s Ben Collins:The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis. Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24. When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber. These people are not allowed at the table.Collins reads this as part of a widespread practice at ESPN of marginalizing female voices, a tendency that enables the network to submit to the powerful league at the moments when it most needs its editorial independence.

   "text": "Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.Trying to console a distraught young boy whose dog had died, Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St. Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.”While it is unclear whether the pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which saw them as a repudiation of conservative Catholic theology that says animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.“My inbox got flooded,” said Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States.Charles Camosy, an author and a professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, said it was difficult to know precisely what Francis meant, since he spoke “in pastoral language that is not really meant to be dissected by academics.”But asked if the remarks had caused a new debate on whether animals have souls, suffer and go to heaven, Camosy said, “In a word: Absolutely.”To some extent, it was not a surprise that Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, would suggest to a saddened child that his lost pet had a place in the afterlife.Theologians cautioned that Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America, the Catholic magazine, said he believed that Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation,” even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals.The question of whether animals go to heaven has been emotionally debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Pius IX, who led the church from 1846 to 1878, strongly supported the doctrine that dogs and other animals have no consciousness.Laura Hobgood-Oster, professor of religion and environmental studies at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, said: “Historically, the Catholic Church has never been clear on this question; it’s all over the place, because it begs so many other questions. Where do mosquitoes go, for God’s sake?”",

   "text": "The Department of Homeland Security definitively debunked the persistent right-wing media conspiracy theory that Islamic State fighters have attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying the rumor is not supported by any \"credible intelligence\" and knocking the claim that the terrorists have been apprehended at the border as \"categorically false.\" What began early this summer as an unsubstantiated claim from Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) that \"people that are coming [across the U.S.-Mexico border] from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations,\" (a claim PolitiFact Texas rated \"Pants on Fire\"), has morphed into a full-blown right-wing conspiracy theory. Conservative media and elected officials are hyping fears that members of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL) terrorist group are utilizing the U.S.-Mexico border to enter the U.S. and launch terrorist attacks, a chorus that has only grown louder in the ensuing months to attack immigration reform.In September, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) claimed to have seen information detailing \"four individuals trying to cross through the Texas border who were apprehended at two different stations that do have ties to known terrorists organizations in the Middle East,\" a story subsequently hyped by Fox News. Nearly a month later, the number had jumped from four terrorists allegedly apprehended to 10.Fox News' On The Record provided a platform to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) who claimed to have first-hand knowledge of the terrorists crossing the border. Host Greta Van Susteren replied to Hunter's allegations by asking, \"Do you have any information, or any evidence, that they are actually coming in the southern border now?\" And Hunter responded, \"Yes. ... I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,\" citing information he'd received from border patrol agents.But the right-wing talking point is \"categorically false,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security. On October 8, DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron refuted the rumor that Islamic State terrorists had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, telling The New Republic: \"The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,\" said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron. \"DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.\"It remains to be seen whether DHS's facts permeate the right-wing bubble. After hearing the DHS statement, Sean Hannity claimed on his radio program that the agency could not be trusted and suggested it may be lying.",

   "text": "An article saying a “planetary alignment” on January 4, 2015, “will decrease gravity for 5 minutes” and cause partial weightlessness is fake.Every year, there’s been rumors about a so-called “planetary alignment,” but they’re obviously fake.The hoax originated in the 1970s when British astronomer Patrick Moore made it up, telling his radio audience that the alignment would result in a gravitational pull that would make people lighter at 9:47 a.m. local time.As Time magazine noted in a 2011 article:The British media have a unique affinity for pulling April Fools’ pranks, matched only by the British public’s unique ability to fall for them. On April 1, 1976, BBC Radio 2 astronomer Sir Patrick Moore gave listeners some bunk about how, at 9:47 a.m., Pluto and Jupiter would align in such a way as to temporarily reduce Earth’s gravity. Moore told listeners to jump at exactly that time to experience the once-in-a-lifetime effect. At 9:48, callers flooded the lines, eager to describe how they had briefly floated. News that Moore had played them no doubt brought everyone crashing back to earth.A few days ago, fake news website Daily Buzz Live posted a variation of the hoax, which generated tens of thousands of Facebook shares in a short time. It reads:Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.The site has a disclaimer, which basically says it publishes fake news:Daily Buzz Live is a news web publication with news articles. Most are inspired by real news events, And just a few stories are works of complete fiction. Those few articles are for entertainment purposes only.

He was put in an ambulance but latter “succumbed to his injuries”, Ottawa Police said.The shooter then jumped into a car and sped off, though whether this gunman was behind the shoot-out at the Canadian Parliament minutes later is still unconfirmed. An assailant who entered Parliament was shot dead by sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers.A Canadian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the dead suspect is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, Associated Press reports, but could not give more details on a possible motive nor details of his background.However, local reports say that Zehaf-Bibeau was Canadian-born, while Reuters have reported that he was a convert to Islam and was from Quebec.Earlier today at a press conference following the dramatic incident in Canada’s capital city of Ottawa, Mayor Jim Watson said: “I urge all of my fellow residents to think of the individual standing on guard this morning at the National War Memorial.“Remember how that one person's life has been taken from us - from family, from friends, from the future that was to be his.”As reported by CBC News, Cirillo was just one of the guards on duty, who make up of a larger roster of soldiers that rotate on an hourly or bi-hourly basis. They also carry unloaded rifles.Officials also said that the incident \"caught us surprise\", despite the government upgrading its terror threat from low to medium a day prior due to \"general chatter\" online from jihadist groups including Isis.An Facebook group in memory of Cirillo has already had over 10,000 followers, with friends and acquaintances of the solider reportedly emailing in their memories of him.A comment on his profile picture on Facebook reads: “RIP Nathan! Thank you for defending our country, your son is so proud of you. I miss you.”Student soldiers within the Armed Forces have also reportedly been told not to wear their uniforms, including when on base or inside their cars.At the press conference today officials also said that today's incident \"caught us by surprise\", despite the threat level being raised from low to",

   "text": "BREAKING NEWS: Sources are reporting that Judd Nelson, best known for his roles as John Bender in The Breakfast Club, has been found dead at age 55.Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m.Although police have not yet released the man's identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson's condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner will determine the cause of death as investigators try to rule out foul play.Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in many films but it was his roles in John Hughes's The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire that made Nelson a star. A subsequent article in New York magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term \"Brat Pack\" being coined.In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie and was signed on to voice Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime again in the live action movie Transformers 5.Additional details and information will be updated as it becomes available. This story is still developing.",

   "text": "The former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee who says Comcast got him fired from his job set an Oct. 14 deadline for the company to respond to his demands of a full apology and a monetary settlement, and got a half-assed apology instead. Two days after the deadline passed, he stuck to his word and filed a lawsuit.Conal O'Rourke is going after Comcast and its controller, Lawrence Salva, for defamation, and arguing the company violated federal regulations with its poor service and overbilling.In his complaint, O'Rourke alleges that Salva, a former partner at PWC, called up an executive at PWC's Philadelphia office and used Comcast's leverage as a major client to have O'Rourke investigated for \"ethics violations\" and ultimately fired.O'Rourke says Comcast and Salva defamed him by telling his employer he threw PNC's name around on the phone in an attempt to get his Comcast service issues resolved—he claims he never told anyone at Comcast who he worked for, and he wants Comcast to release tapes and emails from his interactions with the controller's office prove it.Oh, and about those service issues: O'Rourke's complaint also argues Comcast's mistreatment of him as a customer violated the Cable Communications Policy Act, and lists some particularly egregious examples:Comcast habitually misspelled Mr. O'Rourke's name as Mr. O'Kourke, making it difficult for him to receive his Comcast bills in a timely fashion, because the postal service would fail to deliver them. Ultimately, Mr. O'Rourke convinced the postal service to deliver mail to him that was addressed to \"Mr. O'Kourke,\" after he was unable to convince Comcast to even correct the spelling of his name.In addition to Comcast's continual failure to address Mr. O'Rourke's billing issues, in late November or early December of 2013, when Mr. O'Rourke was out of town, Comcast shipped Mr. O'Rourke twelve random pieces of Comcast equipment. Comcast then proceeded to charge Mr. O'Rourke almost $2,000 in fees for equipment that he had neither requested nor wanted.When he tried to get help with these issues, he says, Comcast sent him to collections. That's when he took his complaint directly to the controller, and allegedly lost his job as a result. He says he never received a single correct bill in the entire year he was a Comcast customer.Although O'Rourke originally said he would sue to get his job back, the complaint simply asks for legal fees and damages—i.e., the lost wages from the six months he's been unemployed—and an injunction stopping The Worst Company in America from overbilling customers.Good luck with that last part.",

The photo has apparently gone viral in China.Huxiu reports that the photo was shared by a micro-blog today under the heading, \"It's Hard Being a Top App Worker.\" The image shows a worker siting in front of hundreds of iPhones laid out on a rack that appears to have been specially designed for this purpose.The exposé, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. Accompany the photo on some sites is an alleged price list for boosting your app ranking. Getting into the top 10 free apps costs RMB 70,000 (US$11,200), and keeping it there will cost you another RMB 405,000 (US$65,000) per week. The third column is said to be the monthly fee.

They've got places to go medically or where they can get help from an agency.YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit.One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh.Before his haircut he said he was upset at how grey he had become and how long his hair had grownA store attendant stands alongside Thomas in the mirror as he admires one of the number of suits he tried on during a visit to a mallWit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler LinGesture... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making moneyTwist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right)Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTubeProfitable: Some have highlighted the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from the film's success - up to an enormous $52,000 (above, in red), according to socialblade.com , which tracks YouTube channel statistics'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened.'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.'Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site.'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin.Fine dining: Thomas is pictured tucking into a Christmas meal in another photo posted on Lin's InstagramIn good spirits: Alongside the picture, YouTube personality Lin wrote: 'I think Thomas had a good X'mas meal'Using chopsticks: Lin captioned this photo of Thomas: 'Taking Thomas to eat Shabu Shabu in this Xmas eve'A strange choice: One YouTube user questioned Thomas's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away (pictured) for his food shop - as opposed to a nearer supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash.The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax.Why did Thomas buy food from a liquor store, not a cheaper grocery store?Why did he stop at a shop a 34-minute walk from the park instead of the shop closest to the park?If Josh Paler Lin’s business is to make viral-hit videos, why did he set out to ‘expose’ a homeless person spending $100 on booze?Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside.'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said.He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart.After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people.However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'.Criticism: One Twitter user, with the handle Cornelius, said the video would shortly be 'exposed as fake'Joking: One British user joked that he was heading off 'to create a fake homeless friend' and then appeal to locals for donations - following in the wake of Lin's successful fundraising on Indiegogo for ThomasCasting doubt: Another YouTube user (pictured), with the handle, ClemtheRanter , said Lin is a well-known prankster whom previously worked on a Halloween-themed video with him that was 'set up' to gain trafficHistory of fakes? 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a Halloween-themed bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin'. Above, footage of the apparently 'fake' eyeball prank'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper.'That would go with the staging thing because it's like, \"oh look at that, it's a happy twist ending\", and that would make people share it.'However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.'When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park.But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange.You're welcome: In Lin's homeless video, Thomas apparently begrudgingly accepts the $100 cash from himNext: The beggar then walks into a Liquor Mart, where he purchases food for his beggar friends, not alcoholGiving: The camera following Thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in‘I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn’t,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.'However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit.Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers.'[Lin] knows what makes people share videos. He knows all the tactics, probably,' added the user.Other social media users have pointed out that the video apparently cuts several times as Paler Lin speaks to him by the side of a busy road, meaning he would be able to edit out bad acting.Candid camera: Lin eventually approaches Thomas to reveal he has been followed. Thomas appears shockedGrateful: Lin says he was shocked at how the experiment turned out - and has defended its authenticityAnd some have said that Thomas's reaction to the camera - 'oh yeah' - was not very realistic.After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn’t expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.'He added: 'I’m so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel.'I did not only just help a homeless man, but I actually met an incredible human being and a friend. We were following him for a couple miles for almost an hour or so.'In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street.Another video: In November 2013, Lin (pictured, left) gave another homeless man (right) $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. The video gained far fewer views than Thomas'sA kind gesture: Again, the beggar handed over some cash (left), prompting the actor to hug him (right)So taken aback by what happen, Paler Lin said he later took the man the man out for dinner and put him up in a hotel for the night. He also gave him an extra $100 cash.'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' he said.Since uploading the video, Paler Lin has posted a number of photos of Thomas to Instagram, including the beggar dressed in a suit and eating a couple of Christmas meals.He captioned one of the images: 'I think Thomas had a good X'mas meal!'",

   "text": "eBay may be developing an app for the Apple Watch which ties to its existing iPhone and iPad software, as per a job listing AppleInsider highlighted yesterday.Originally posted to eBay’s careers webpage in November, the ad was spotted recently on LinkedIn.The ad states the bespoke Watch app is being developed by the company’s New Technology Group, which employs over 200 engineers in product development in Portland.An ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app,” reads the ad.That line led AppleInsider to theorize that “Apple Watch owners may never need to worry about being outbid in an eBay auction again.”It’s interesting that eBay’s New Technology Group will also be developing solutions for CarPlay and Apple TV. As you know, Apple’s media-streaming box currently does not allow third-party apps.The Group will be “exploring other opportunities within the Apple ecosystem,” too.CEO Tim Cook came clean on the Apple Watch release date: in an earnings call yesterday, he finally confirmed that the wrist-worn device, which starts at $349, will hit store shelves in April.Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac, who was adamant the Watch would arrive in March, recently learned from unnamed sources the Watch was capable of two and a half hours of gameplay or app use, three and a half hours of standard app use and four hours of fitness tracking, as of 2014.But as Apple continues to optimize the Watch software and hardware ahead of April launch, it’s entirely possible its engineers will be able to squeeze more juice out of its battery than originally thought.Dodging battery life questions since its unveiling, Apple would only vaguely confirm that fans will have to charge the Watch overnight.",
